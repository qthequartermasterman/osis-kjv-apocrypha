      <chapter osisID="4Macc.1" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.1">The subject that I am about to discuss is most philosophical, that is, whether devout reason is sovereign over the emotions. So it is right for me to advise you to pay earnest attention to philosophy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.2">For the subject is essential to everyone who is seeking knowledge, and in addition it includes the praise of the highest virtue -- I mean, of course, rational judgment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.3">If, then, it is evident that reason rules over those emotions that hinder self-control, namely, gluttony and lust,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.4">it is also clear that it masters the emotions that hinder one from justice, such as malice, and those that stand in the way of courage, namely anger, fear, and pain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.5">Some might perhaps ask, "If reason rules the emotions, why is it not sovereign over forgetfulness and ignorance?" Their attempt at argument is ridiculous!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.6">For reason does not rule its own emotions, but those that are opposed to justice, courage, and self-control; and it is not for the purpose of destroying them, but so that one may not give way to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.7">I could prove to you from many and various examples that reason is dominant over the emotions,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.8">but I can demonstrate it best from the noble bravery of those who died for the sake of virtue, Eleazar and the seven brothers and their mother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.9">All of these, by despising sufferings that bring death, demonstrated that reason controls the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.10">On this anniversary it is fitting for me to praise for their virtues those who, with their mother, died for the sake of nobility and goodness, but I would also call them blessed for the honor in which they are held.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.11">For all people, even their torturers, marveled at their courage and endurance, and they became the cause of the downfall of tyranny over their nation. By their endurance they conquered the tyrant, and thus their native land was purified through them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.12">I shall shortly have an opportunity to speak of this; but, as my custom is, I shall begin by stating my main principle, and then I shall turn to their story, giving glory to the all-wise God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.13">Our inquiry, accordingly, is whether reason is sovereign over the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.14">We shall decide just what reason is and what emotion is, how many kinds of emotions there are, and whether reason rules over all these.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.15">Now reason is the mind that with sound logic prefers the life of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.16">Wisdom, next, is the knowledge of divine and human matters and the causes of these.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.17">This, in turn, is education in the law, by which we learn divine matters reverently and human affairs to our advantage.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.18">Now the kinds of wisdom are rational judgment, justice, courage, and self-control.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.19">Rational judgment is supreme over all of these, since by means of it reason rules over the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.20">The two most comprehensive types of the emotions are pleasure and pain; and each of these is by nature concerned with both body and soul.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.21">The emotions of both pleasure and pain have many consequences.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.22">Thus desire precedes pleasure and delight follows it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.23">Fear precedes pain and sorrow comes after.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.24">Anger, as a man will see if he reflects on this experience, is an emotion embracing pleasure and pain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.25">In pleasure there exists even a malevolent tendency, which is the most complex of all the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.26">In the soul it is boastfulness, covetousness, thirst for honor, rivalry, and malice;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.27">in the body, indiscriminate eating, gluttony, and solitary gormandizing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.28">Just as pleasure and pain are two plants growing from the body and the soul, so there are many offshoots of these plants,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.29">each of which the master cultivator, reason, weeds and prunes and ties up and waters and thoroughly irrigates, and so tames the jungle of habits and emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.30">For reason is the guide of the virtues, but over the emotions it is sovereign. Observe now first of all that rational judgment is sovereign over the emotions by virtue of the restraining power of self-control.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.31">Self-control, then, is dominance over the desires.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.32">Some desires are mental, others are physical, and reason obviously rules over both.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.33">Otherwise how is it that when we are attracted to forbidden foods we abstain from the pleasure to be had from them? Is it not because reason is able to rule over appetites? I for one think so.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.34">Therefore when we crave seafood and fowl and animals and all sorts of foods that are forbidden to us by the law, we abstain because of domination by reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.35">For the emotions of the appetites are restrained, checked by the temperate mind, and all the impulses of the body are bridled by reason.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.2" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.1">And why is it amazing that the desires of the mind for the enjoyment of beauty are rendered powerless?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.2">It is for this reason, certainly, that the temperate Joseph is praised, because by mental effort he overcame sexual desire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.3">For when he was young and in his prime for intercourse, by his reason he nullified the frenzy of the passions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.4">Not only is reason proved to rule over the frenzied urge of sexual desire, but also over every desire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.5">Thus the law says, "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife...or anything that is your neighbor's."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.6">In fact, since the law has told us not to covet, I could prove to you all the more that reason is able to control desires. Just so it is with the emotions that hinder one from justice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.7">Otherwise how could it be that someone who is habitually a solitary gormandizer, a glutton, or even a drunkard can learn a better way, unless reason is clearly lord of the emotions?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.8">Thus, as soon as a man adopts a way of life in accordance with the law, even though he is a lover of money, he is forced to act contrary to his natural ways and to lend without interest to the needy and to cancel the debt when the seventh year arrives.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.9">If one is greedy, he is ruled by the law through his reason so that he neither gleans his harvest nor gathers the last grapes from the vineyard. In all other matters we can recognize that reason rules the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.10">For the law prevails even over affection for parents, so that virtue is not abandoned for their sakes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.11">It is superior to love for one's wife, so that one rebukes her when she breaks the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.12">It takes precedence over love for children, so that one punishes them for misdeeds.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.13">It is sovereign over the relationship of friends, so that one rebukes friends when they act wickedly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.14">Do not consider it paradoxical when reason, through the law, can prevail even over enmity. The fruit trees of the enemy are not cut down, but one preserves the property of enemies from the destroyers and helps raise up what has fallen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.15">It is evident that reason rules even the more violent emotions: lust for power, vainglory, boasting, arrogance, and malice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.16">For the temperate mind repels all these malicious emotions, just as it repels anger -- for it is sovereign over even this.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.17">When Moses was angry with Dathan and Abiram he did nothing against them in anger, but controlled his anger by reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.18">For, as I have said, the temperate mind is able to get the better of the emotions, to correct some, and to render others powerless.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.19">Why else did Jacob, our most wise father, censure the households of Simeon and Levi for their irrational slaughter of the entire tribe of the Shechemites, saying, "Cursed be their anger"?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.20">For if reason could not control anger, he would not have spoken thus.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.21">Now when God fashioned man, he planted in him emotions and inclinations,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.22">but at the same time he enthroned the mind among the senses as a sacred governor over them all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.23">To the mind he gave the law; and one who lives subject to this will rule a kingdom that is temperate, just, good, and courageous.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.24">How is it then, one might say, that if reason is master of the emotions, it does not control forgetfulness and ignorance?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.3" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.1">This notion is entirely ridiculous; for it is evident that reason rules not over its own emotions, but over those of the body.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.2">No one of us can eradicate that kind of desire, but reason can provide a way for us not to be enslaved by desire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.3">No one of us can eradicate anger from the mind, but reason can help to deal with anger.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.4">No one of us can eradicate malice, but reason can fight at our side so that we are not overcome by malice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.5">For reason does not uproot the emotions but is their antagonist.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.6">Now this can be explained more clearly by the story of King David's thirst.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.7">David had been attacking the Philistines all day long, and together with the soldiers of his nation had slain many of them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.8">Then when evening fell, he came, sweating and quite exhausted, to the royal tent, around which the whole army of our ancestors had encamped.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.9">Now all the rest were at supper,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.10">but the king was extremely thirsty, and although springs were plentiful there, he could not satisfy his thirst from them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.11">But a certain irrational desire for the water in the enemy's territory tormented and inflamed him, undid and consumed him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.12">When his guards complained bitterly because of the king's craving, two staunch young soldiers, respecting the king's desire, armed themselves fully, and taking a pitcher climbed over the enemy's ramparts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.13">Eluding the sentinels at the gates, they went searching throughout the enemy camp</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.14">and found the spring, and from it boldly brought the king a drink.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.15">But David, although he was burning with thirst, considered it an altogether fearful danger to his soul to drink what was regarded as equivalent to blood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.16">Therefore, opposing reason to desire, he poured out the drink as an offering to God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.17">For the temperate mind can conquer the drives of the emotions and quench the flames of frenzied desires;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.18">it can overthrow bodily agonies even when they are extreme, and by nobility of reason spurn all domination by the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.19">The present occasion now invites us to a narrative demonstration of temperate reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.20">At a time when our fathers were enjoying profound peace because of their observance of the law and were prospering, so that even Seleucus Nicanor, king of Asia, had both appropriated money to them for the temple service and recognized their commonwealth --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.21">just at that time certain men attempted a revolution against the public harmony and caused many and various disasters.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.1">Now there was a certain Simon, a political opponent of the noble and good man, Onias, who then held the high priesthood for life. When despite all manner of slander he was unable to injure Onias in the eyes of the nation, he fled the country with the purpose of betraying it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.2">So he came to Apollonius, governor of Syria, Phoenicia, and Cilicia, and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.3">"I have come here because I am loyal to the king's government, to report that in the Jerusalem treasuries there are deposited tens of thousands in private funds, which are not the property of the temple but belong to King Seleucus."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.4">When Apollonius learned the details of these things, he praised Simon for his service to the king and went up to Seleucus to inform him of the rich treasure.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.5">On receiving authority to deal with this matter, he proceeded quickly to our country accompanied by the accursed Simon and a very strong military force.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.6">He said that he had come with the king's authority to seize the private funds in the treasury.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.7">The people indignantly protested his words, considering it outrageous that those who had committed deposits to the sacred treasury should be deprived of them, and did all that they could to prevent it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.8">But, uttering threats, Apollonius went on to the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.9">While the priests together with women and children were imploring God in the temple to shield the holy place that was being treated so contemptuously,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.10">and while Apollonius was going up with his armed forces to seize the money, angels on horseback with lightning flashing from their weapons appeared from heaven, instilling in them great fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.11">Then Apollonius fell down half dead in the temple area that was open to all, stretched out his hands toward heaven, and with tears besought the Hebrews to pray for him and propitiate the wrath of the heavenly army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.12">For he said that he had committed a sin deserving of death, and that if he were delivered he would praise the blessedness of the holy place before all people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.13">Moved by these words, Onias the high priest, although otherwise he had scruples about doing so, prayed for him lest King Seleucus suppose that Apollonius had been overcome by human treachery and not by divine justice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.14">So Apollonius, having been preserved beyond all expectations, went away to report to the king what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.15">When King Seleucus died, his son Antiochus Epiphanes succeeded to the throne, an arrogant and terrible man,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.16">who removed Onias from the priesthood and appointed Onias's brother Jason as high priest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.17">Jason agreed that if the office were conferred upon him he would pay the king three thousand six hundred and sixty talents annually.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.18">So the king appointed him high priest and ruler of the nation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.19">Jason changed the nation's way of life and altered its form of government in complete violation of the law,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.20">so that not only was a gymnasium constructed at the very citadel of our native land, but also the temple service was abolished.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.21">The divine justice was angered by these acts and caused Antiochus himself to make war on them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.22">For when he was warring against Ptolemy in Egypt, he heard that a rumor of his death had spread and that the people of Jerusalem had rejoiced greatly. He speedily marched against them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.23">and after he had plundered them he issued a decree that if any of them should be found observing the ancestral law they should die.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.24">When, by means of his decrees, he had not been able in any way to put an end to the people's observance of the law, but saw that all his threats and punishments were being disregarded,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.25">even to the point that women, because they had circumcised their sons, were thrown headlong from heights along with their infants, though they had known beforehand that they would suffer this --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.26">when, then, his decrees were despised by the people, he himself, through torture, tried to compel everyone in the nation to eat defiling foods and to renounce Judaism.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.5" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.1">The tyrant Antiochus, sitting in state with his counselors on a certain high place, and with his armed soldiers standing about him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.2">ordered the guards to seize each and every Hebrew and to compel them to eat pork and food sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.3">If any were not willing to eat defiling food, they were to be broken on the wheel and killed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.4">And when many persons had been rounded up, one man, Eleazar by name, leader of the flock, was brought before the king. He was a man of priestly family, learned in the law, advanced in age, and known to many in the tyrant's court because of his philosophy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.5">When Antiochus saw him he said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.6">"Before I begin to torture you, old man, I would advise you to save yourself by eating pork,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.7">for I respect your age and your gray hairs. Although you have had them for so long a time, it does not seem to me that you are a philosopher when you observe the religion of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.8">Why, when nature has granted it to us, should you abhor eating the very excellent meat of this animal?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.9">It is senseless not to enjoy delicious things that are not shameful, and wrong to spurn the gifts of nature.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.10">It seems to me that you will do something even more senseless if, by holding a vain opinion concerning the truth, you continue to despise me to your own hurt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.11">Will you not awaken from your foolish philosophy, dispel your futile reasonings, adopt a mind appropriate to your years, philosophize according to the truth of what is beneficial,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.12">and have compassion on your old age by honoring my humane advice?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.13">For consider this, that if there is some power watching over this religion of yours, it will excuse you from any transgression that arises out of compulsion."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.14">When the tyrant urged him in this fashion to eat meat unlawfully, Eleazar asked to have a word.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.15">When he had received permission to speak, he began to address the people as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.16">"We, O Antiochus, who have been persuaded to govern our lives by the divine law, think that there is no compulsion more powerful than our obedience to the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.17">Therefore we consider that we should not transgress it in any respect.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.18">Even if, as you suppose, our law were not truly divine and we had wrongly held it to be divine, not even so would it be right for us to invalidate our reputation for piety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.19">Therefore do not suppose that it would be a petty sin if we were to eat defiling food;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.20">to transgress the law in matters either small or great is of equal seriousness,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.21">for in either case the law is equally despised.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.22">You scoff at our philosophy as though living by it were irrational,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.23">but it teaches us self-control, so that we master all pleasures and desires, and it also trains us in courage, so that we endure any suffering willingly;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.24">it instructs us in justice, so that in all our dealings we act impartially, and it teaches us piety, so that with proper reverence we worship the only real God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.25">"Therefore we do not eat defiling food; for since we believe that the law was established by God, we know that in the nature of things the Creator of the world in giving us the law has shown sympathy toward us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.26">He has permitted us to eat what will be most suitable for our lives, but he has forbidden us to eat meats that would be contrary to this.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="4Macc.6" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.1">When Eleazar in this manner had made eloquent response to the exhortations of the tyrant, the guards who were standing by dragged him violently to the instruments of torture.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.2">First they stripped the old man, who remained adorned with the gracefulness of his piety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.3">And after they had tied his arms on each side they scourged him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.4">while a herald opposite him cried out, "Obey the king's commands!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.5">But the courageous and noble man, as a true Eleazar, was unmoved, as though being tortured in a dream;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.6">yet while the old man's eyes were raised to heaven, his flesh was being torn by scourges, his blood flowing, and his sides were being cut to pieces.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.7">And though he fell to the ground because his body could not endure the agonies, he kept his reason upright and unswerving.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.8">One of the cruel guards rushed at him and began to kick him in the side to make him get up again after he fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.9">But he bore the pains and scorned the punishment and endured the tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.10">And like a noble athlete the old man, while being beaten, was victorious over his torturers;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.11">in fact, with his face bathed in sweat, and gasping heavily for breath, he amazed even his torturers by his courageous spirit.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.12">At that point, partly out of pity for his old age,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.13">partly out of sympathy from their acquaintance with him, partly out of admiration for his endurance, some of the king's retinue came to him and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.14">"Eleazar, why are you so irrationally destroying yourself through these evil things?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.15">We will set before you some cooked meat; save yourself by pretending to eat pork."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.16">But Eleazar, as though more bitterly tormented by this counsel, cried out:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.17">"May we, the children of Abraham, never think so basely that out of cowardice we feign a role unbecoming to us!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.18">For it would be irrational if we, who have lived in accordance with truth to old age and have maintained in accordance with law the reputation of such a life, should now change our course</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.19">become a pattern of impiety to the young, in becoming an example of the eating of defiling food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.20">It would be shameful if we should survive for a little while and during that time be a laughing stock to all for our cowardice,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.21">and if we should be despised by the tyrant as unmanly, and not protect our divine law even to death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.22">Therefore, O children of Abraham, die nobly for your religion!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.23">And you, guards of the tyrant, why do you delay?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.24">When they saw that he was so courageous in the face of the afflictions, and that he had not been changed by their compassion, the guards brought him to the fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.25">There they burned him with maliciously contrived instruments, threw him down, and poured stinking liquids into his nostrils.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.26">When he was now burned to his very bones and about to expire, he lifted up his eyes to God and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.27">"You know, O God, that though I might have saved myself, I am dying in burning torments for the sake of the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.28">Be merciful to your people, and let our punishment suffice for them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.29">Make my blood their purification, and take my life in exchange for theirs."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.30">And after he said this, the holy man died nobly in his tortures, and by reason he resisted even to the very tortures of death for the sake of the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.31">Admittedly, then, devout reason is sovereign over the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.32">For if the emotions had prevailed over reason, we would have testified to their domination.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.33">But now that reason has conquered the emotions, we properly attribute to it the power to govern.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.34">And it is right for us to acknowledge the dominance of reason when it masters even external agonies. It would be ridiculous to deny it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.35">And I have proved not only that reason has mastered agonies, but also that it masters pleasures and in no respect yields to them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.7" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.1">For like a most skilful pilot, the reason of our father Eleazar steered the ship of religion over the sea of the emotions,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.2">and though buffeted by the stormings of the tyrant and overwhelmed by the mighty waves of tortures,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.3">in no way did he turn the rudder of religion until he sailed into the haven of immortal victory.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.4">No city besieged with many ingenious war machines has ever held out as did that most holy man. Although his sacred life was consumed by tortures and racks, he conquered the besiegers with the shield of his devout reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.5">For in setting his mind firm like a jutting cliff, our father Eleazar broke the maddening waves of the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.6">O priest, worthy of the priesthood, you neither defiled your sacred teeth nor profaned your stomach, which had room only for reverence and purity, by eating defiling foods.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.7">O man in harmony with the law and philosopher of divine life!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.8">Such should be those who are administrators of the law, shielding it with their own blood and noble sweat in sufferings even to death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.9">You, father, strengthened our loyalty to the law through your glorious endurance, and you did not abandon the holiness which you praised, but by your deeds you made your words of divine philosophy credible.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.10">O aged man, more powerful than tortures; O elder, fiercer than fire; O supreme king over the passions, Eleazar!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.11">For just as our father Aaron, armed with the censer, ran through the multitude of the people and conquered the fiery angel,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.12">so the descendant of Aaron, Eleazar, though being consumed by the fire, remained unmoved in his reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.13">Most amazing, indeed, though he was an old man, his body no longer tense and firm, his muscles flabby, his sinews feeble, he became young again</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.14">in spirit through reason; and by reason like that of Isaac he rendered the many-headed rack ineffective.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.15">O man of blessed age and of venerable gray hair and of law-abiding life, whom the faithful seal of death has perfected!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.16">If, therefore, because of piety an aged man despised tortures even to death, most certainly devout reason is governor of the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.17">Some perhaps might say, "Not every one has full command of his emotions, because not every one has prudent reason."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.18">But as many as attend to religion with a whole heart, these alone are able to control the passions of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.19">since they believe that they, like our patriarchs Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, do not die to God, but live in God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.20">No contradiction therefore arises when some persons appear to be dominated by their emotions because of the weakness of their reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.21">What person who lives as a philosopher by the whole rule of philosophy, and trusts in God,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.22">and knows that it is blessed to endure any suffering for the sake of virtue, would not be able to overcome the emotions through godliness?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.23">For only the wise and courageous man is lord of his emotions.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.8" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.1">For this is why even the very young, by following a philosophy in accordance with devout reason, have prevailed over the most painful instruments of torture.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.2">For when the tyrant was conspicuously defeated in his first attempt, being unable to compel an aged man to eat defiling foods, then in violent rage he commanded that others of the Hebrew captives be brought, and that any who ate defiling food should be freed after eating, but if any were to refuse, these should be tortured even more cruelly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.3">When the tyrant had given these orders, seven brothers -- handsome, modest, noble, and accomplished in every way -- were brought before him along with their aged mother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.4">When the tyrant saw them, grouped about their mother as if in a chorus, he was pleased with them. And struck by their appearance and nobility, he smiled at them, and summoned them nearer and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.5">"Young men, I admire each and every one of you in a kindly manner, and greatly respect the beauty and the number of such brothers. Not only do I advise you not to display the same madness as that of the old man who has just been tortured, but I also exhort you to yield to me and enjoy my friendship.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.6">Just as I am able to punish those who disobey my orders, so I can be a benefactor to those who obey me.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.7">Trust me, then, and you will have positions of authority in my government if you will renounce the ancestral tradition of your national life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.8">And enjoy your youth by adopting the Greek way of life and by changing your manner of living.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.9">But if by disobedience you rouse my anger, you will compel me to destroy each and every one of you with dreadful punishments through tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.10">Therefore take pity on yourselves. Even I, your enemy, have compassion for your youth and handsome appearance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.11">Will you not consider this, that if you disobey, nothing remains for you but to die on the rack?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.12">When he had said these things, he ordered the instruments of torture to be brought forward so as to persuade them out of fear to eat the defiling food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.13">And when the guards had placed before them wheels and joint-dislocators, rack and hooks and catapults and caldrons, braziers and thumbscrews and iron claws and wedges and bellows, the tyrant resumed speaking:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.14">"Be afraid, young fellows, and whatever justice you revere will be merciful to you when you transgress under compulsion."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.15">But when they had heard the inducements and saw the dreadful devices, not only were they not afraid, but they also opposed the tyrant with their own philosophy, and by their right reasoning nullified his tyranny.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.16">Let us consider, on the other hand, what arguments might have been used if some of them had been cowardly and unmanly. Would they not have been these?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.17">"O wretches that we are and so senseless! Since the king has summoned and exhorted us to accept kind treatment if we obey him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.18">why do we take pleasure in vain resolves and venture upon a disobedience that brings death?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.19">O men and brothers, should we not fear the instruments of torture and consider the threats of torments, and give up this vain opinion and this arrogance that threatens to destroy us?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.20">Let us take pity on our youth and have compassion on our mother's age;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.21">and let us seriously consider that if we disobey we are dead!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.22">Also, divine justice will excuse us for fearing the king when we are under compulsion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.23">Why do we banish ourselves from this most pleasant life and deprive ourselves of this delightful world?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.24">Let us not struggle against compulsion nor take hollow pride in being put to the rack.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.25">Not even the law itself would arbitrarily slay us for fearing the instruments of torture.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.26">Why does such contentiousness excite us and such a fatal stubbornness please us, when we can live in peace if we obey the king?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.27">But the youths, though about to be tortured, neither said any of these things nor even seriously considered them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.28">For they were contemptuous of the emotions and sovereign over agonies,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.29">so that as soon as the tyrant had ceased counseling them to eat defiling food, all with one voice together, as from one mind, said:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.9" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.1">"Why do you delay, O tyrant? For we are ready to die rather than transgress our ancestral commandments;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.2">we are obviously putting our forefathers to shame unless we should practice ready obedience to the law and to Moses our counselor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.3">Tyrant and counselor of lawlessness, in your hatred for us do not pity us more than we pity ourselves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.4">For we consider this pity of yours which insures our safety through transgression of the law to be more grievous than death itself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.5">You are trying to terrify us by threatening us with death by torture, as though a short time ago you learned nothing from Eleazar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.6">And if the aged men of the Hebrews because of their religion lived piously while enduring torture, it would be even more fitting that we young men should die despising your coercive tortures, which our aged instructor also overcame.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.7">Therefore, tyrant, put us to the test; and if you take our lives because of our religion, do not suppose that you can injure us by torturing us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.8">For we, through this severe suffering and endurance, shall have the prize of virtue and shall be with God, for whom we suffer;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.9">but you, because of your bloodthirstiness toward us, will deservedly undergo from the divine justice eternal torment by fire."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.10">When they had said these things the tyrant not only was angry, as at those who are disobedient, but also was enraged, as at those who are ungrateful.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.11">Then at his command the guards brought forward the eldest, and having torn off his tunic, they bound his hands and arms with thongs on each side.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.12">When they had worn themselves out beating him with scourges, without accomplishing anything, they placed him upon the wheel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.13">When the noble youth was stretched out around this, his limbs were dislocated,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.14">and though broken in every member he denounced the tyrant, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.15">"Most abominable tyrant, enemy of heavenly justice, savage of mind, you are mangling me in this manner, not because I am a murderer, or as one who acts impiously, but because I protect the divine law."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.16">And when the guards said, "Agree to eat so that you may be released from the tortures,"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.17">he replied, "You abominable lackeys, your wheel is not so powerful as to strangle my reason. Cut my limbs, burn my flesh, and twist my joints.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.18">Through all these tortures I will convince you that sons of the Hebrews alone are invincible where virtue is concerned."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.19">While he was saying these things, they spread fire under him, and while fanning the flames they tightened the wheel further.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.20">The wheel was completely smeared with blood, and the heap of coals was being quenched by the drippings of gore, and pieces of flesh were falling off the axles of the machine.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.21">Although the ligaments joining his bones were already severed, the courageous youth, worthy of Abraham, did not groan,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.22">but as though transformed by fire into immortality he nobly endured the rackings.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.23">"Imitate me, brothers," he said. "Do not leave your post in my struggle or renounce our courageous brotherhood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.24">Fight the sacred and noble battle for religion. Thereby the just Providence of our ancestors may become merciful to our nation and take vengeance on the accursed tyrant."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.25">When he had said this, the saintly youth broke the thread of life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.26">While all were marveling at his courageous spirit, the guards brought in the next eldest, and after fitting themselves with iron gauntlets having sharp hooks, they bound him to the torture machine and catapult.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.27">Before torturing him, they inquired if he were willing to eat, and they heard this noble decision.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.28">These leopard-like beasts tore out his sinews with the iron hands, flayed all his flesh up to his chin, and tore away his scalp. But he steadfastly endured this agony and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.29">"How sweet is any kind of death for the religion of our fathers!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.30">To the tyrant he said, "Do you not think, you most savage tyrant, that you are being tortured more than I, as you see the arrogant design of your tyranny being defeated by our endurance for the sake of religion?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.31">I lighten my pain by the joys that come from virtue,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.32">but you suffer torture by the threats that come from impiety. You will not escape, most abominable tyrant, the judgments of the divine wrath."</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.1">Since, then, the seven brothers despised sufferings even unto death, everyone must concede that devout reason is sovereign over the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.2">For if they had been slaves to their emotions and had eaten defiling food, we would say that they had been conquered by these emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.3">But in fact it was not so. Instead, by reason, which is praised before God, they prevailed over their emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.4">The supremacy of the mind over these cannot be overlooked, for the brothers mastered both emotions and pains.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.5">How then can one fail to confess the sovereignty of right reason over emotion in those who were not turned back by fiery agonies?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.6">For just as towers jutting out over harbors hold back the threatening waves and make it calm for those who sail into the inner basin,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.7">so the seven-towered right reason of the youths, by fortifying the harbor of religion, conquered the tempest of the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.8">For they constituted a holy chorus of religion and encouraged one another, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.9">"Brothers, let us die like brothers for the sake of the law; let us imitate the three youths in Assyria who despised the same ordeal of the furnace.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.13">Each of them and all of them together looking at one another, cheerful and undaunted, said, "Let us with all our hearts consecrate ourselves to God, who gave us our lives, and let us use our bodies as a bulwark for the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.14">Let us not fear him who thinks he is killing us,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.15">for great is the struggle of the soul and the danger of eternal torment lying before those who transgress the commandment of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.16">Therefore let us put on the full armor of self-control, which is divine reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.17">For if we so die, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob will welcome us, and all the fathers will praise us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.18">Those who were left behind said to each of the brothers who were being dragged away, "Do not put us to shame, brother, or betray the brothers who have died before us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.19">You are not ignorant of the affection of brotherhood, which the divine and all-wise Providence has bequeathed through the fathers to their descendants and which was implanted in the mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.20">There each of the brothers dwelt the same length of time and was shaped during the same period of time; and growing from the same blood and through the same life, they were brought to the light of day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.21">When they were born after an equal time of gestation, they drank milk from the same fountains. For such embraces brotherly-loving souls are nourished;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.22">and they grow stronger from this common nurture and daily companionship, and from both general education and our discipline in the law of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.23">Therefore, when sympathy and brotherly affection had been so established, the brothers were the more sympathetic to one another.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.24">Since they had been educated by the same law and trained in the same virtues and brought up in right living, they loved one another all the more.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.25">A common zeal for nobility expanded their goodwill and harmony toward one another,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.26">because, with the aid of their religion, they rendered their brotherly love more fervent.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.27">But although nature and companionship and virtuous habits had augmented the affection of brotherhood, those who were left endured for the sake of religion, while watching their brothers being maltreated and tortured to death.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.6">Just as the hands and feet are moved in harmony with the guidance of the mind, so those holy youths, as though moved by an immortal spirit of devotion, agreed to go to death for its sake.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.8">so these youths, forming a chorus, encircled the sevenfold fear of tortures and dissolved it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.9">Even now, we ourselves shudder as we hear of the tribulations of these young men; they not only saw what was happening, yes, not only heard the direct word of threat, but also bore the sufferings patiently, and in agonies of fire at that.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.10">What could be more excruciatingly painful than this? For the power of fire is intense and swift, and it consumed their bodies quickly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.11">Do not consider it amazing that reason had full command over these men in their tortures, since the mind of woman despised even more diverse agonies,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.12">for the mother of the seven young men bore up under the rackings of each one of her children.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.13">Observe how complex is a mother's love for her children, which draws everything toward an emotion felt in her inmost parts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.14">Even unreasoning animals, like mankind, have a sympathy and parental love for their offspring.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.15">For example, among birds, the ones that are tame protect their young by building on the housetops,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.16">and the others, by building in precipitous chasms and in holes and tops of trees, hatch the nestlings and ward off the intruder.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.17">If they are not able to keep him away, they do what they can to help their young by flying in circles around them in the anguish of love, warning them with their own calls.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.18">And why is it necessary to demonstrate sympathy for children by the example of unreasoning animals,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.19">since even bees at the time for making honeycombs defend themselves against intruders as though with an iron dart sting those who approach their hive and defend it even to the death?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.20">But sympathy for her children did not sway the mother of the young men; she was of the same mind as Abraham.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.3">She loved religion more, religion that preserves them for eternal life according to God's promise.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.4">In what manner might I express the emotions of parents who love their children?

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.8">yet because of the fear of God she disdained the temporary safety of her children.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.9">Not only so, but also because of the nobility of her sons and their ready obedience to the law she felt a greater tenderness toward them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.10">For they were righteous and self-controlled and brave and magnanimous, and loved their brothers and their mother, so that they obeyed her even to death in keeping the ordinances.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.11">Nevertheless, though so many factors influenced the mother to suffer with them out of love for her children, in the case of none of them were the various tortures strong enough to pervert her reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.12">Instead, the mother urged them on, each child singly and all together, to death for the sake of religion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.13">O sacred nature and affection of parental love, yearning of parents toward offspring, nurture and indomitable suffering by mothers!</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.15">She watched the flesh of her children consumed by fire, their toes and fingers scattered on the ground, and the flesh of the head to the chin exposed like masks.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.18">When the first-born breathed his last it did not turn you aside, nor when the second in torments looked at you piteously nor when the third expired;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.20">When you saw the flesh of children burned upon the flesh of other children, severed hands upon hands, scalped heads upon heads, and corpses fallen on other corpses and when you saw the place filled with many spectators of the torturings, you did not shed tears.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.21">Neither the melodies of sirens nor the songs of swans attract the attention of their hearers as did the voices of the children in torture calling to their mother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.22">How great and how many torments the mother then suffered as her sons were tortured on the wheel and with the hot irons!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.23">But devout reason, giving her heart a man's courage in the very midst of her emotions, strengthened her to disregard her temporal love for her children.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.24">Although she witnessed the destruction of seven children and the ingenious and various rackings, this noble mother disregarded all these because of faith in God.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.2">Thus I have demonstrated not only that men have ruled over the emotions, but also that a woman has despised the fiercest tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.3">The lions surrounding Daniel were not so savage, nor was the raging fiery furnace of Mishael so intensely hot, as was her innate parental love, inflamed as she saw her seven sons tortured in such varied ways.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.5">Consider this also. If this woman, though a mother, had been fainthearted, she would have mourned over them and perhaps spoken as follows:</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.10">Alas, I who had so many and beautiful children am a widow and alone, with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.11">Nor when I die, shall I have any of my sons to bury me."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.12">Yet the sacred and God-fearing mother did not wail with such a lament for any of them, nor did she dissuade any of them from dying, nor did she grieve as they were dying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.13">but, as though having a mind like adamant and giving rebirth for immortality to the whole number of her sons, she implored them and urged them on to death for the sake of religion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.14">O mother, soldier of God in the cause of religion, elder and woman! By steadfastness you have conquered even a tyrant, and in word and deed you have proved more powerful than a man.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.15">For when you and your sons were arrested together, you stood and watched Eleazar being tortured, and said to your sons in the Hebrew language,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.16">"My sons, noble is the contest to which you are called to bear witness for the nation. Fight zealously for our ancestral law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.17">For it would be shameful if, while an aged man endures such agonies for the sake of religion, you young men were to be terrified by tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.18">Remember that it is through God that you have had a share in the world and have enjoyed life,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.19">and therefore you ought to endure any suffering for the sake of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.20">For his sake also our father Abraham was zealous to sacrifice his son Isaac, the ancestor of our nation; and when Isaac saw his father's hand wielding a sword and descending upon him, he did not cower.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.21">And Daniel the righteous was thrown to the lions, and Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael were hurled into the fiery furnace and endured it for the sake of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.22">You too must have the same faith in God and not be grieved.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.23">It is unreasonable for people who have religious knowledge not to withstand pain."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.24">By these words the mother of the seven encouraged and persuaded each of her sons to die rather than violate God's commandment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.25">They knew also that those who die for the sake of God live in God, as do Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the patriarchs.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="4Macc.17" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.1">Some of the guards said that when she also was about to be seized and put to death she threw herself into the flames so that no one might touch her body.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.2">O mother, who with your seven sons nullified the violence of the tyrant, frustrated his evil designs, and showed the courage of your faith!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.3">Nobly set like a roof on the pillars of your sons, you held firm and unswerving against the earthquake of the tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.4">Take courage, therefore, O holy-minded mother, maintaining firm an enduring hope in God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.5">The moon in heaven, with the stars, does not stand so august as you, who, after lighting the way of your star-like seven sons to piety, stand in honor before God and are firmly set in heaven with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.6">For your children were true descendants of father Abraham.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.7">If it were possible for us to paint the history of your piety as an artist might, would not those who first beheld it have shuddered as they saw the mother of the seven children enduring their varied tortures to death for the sake of religion?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.8">Indeed it would be proper to inscribe upon their tomb these words as a reminder to the people of our nation:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.9">"Here lie buried an aged priest and an aged woman and seven sons, because of the violence of the tyrant who wished to destroy the way of life of the Hebrews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.10">They vindicated their nation, looking to God and enduring torture even to death."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.11">Truly the contest in which they were engaged was divine,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.12">for on that day virtue gave the awards and tested them for their endurance. The prize was immortality in endless life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.13">Eleazar was the first contestant, the mother of the seven sons entered the competition, and the brothers contended.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.14">The tyrant was the antagonist, and the world and the human race were the spectators.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.15">Reverence for God was victor and gave the crown to its own athletes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.16">Who did not admire the athletes of the divine legislation? Who were not amazed?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.17">The tyrant himself and all his council marveled at their endurance,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.18">because of which they now stand before the divine throne and live through blessed eternity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.19">For Moses says, "All who are consecrated are under your hands."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.20">These, then, who have been consecrated for the sake of God, are honored, not only with this honor, but also by the fact that because of them our enemies did not rule over our nation,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.21">the tyrant was punished, and the homeland purified -- they having become, as it were, a ransom for the sin of our nation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.22">And through the blood of those devout ones and their death as an expiation, divine Providence preserved Israel that previously had been afflicted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.23">For the tyrant Antiochus, when he saw the courage of their virtue and their endurance under the tortures, proclaimed them to his soldiers as an example for their own endurance,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.24">and this made them brave and courageous for infantry battle and siege, and he ravaged and conquered all his enemies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.18" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.1">O Israelite children, offspring of the seed of Abraham, obey this law and exercise piety in every way,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.2">knowing that devout reason is master of all emotions, not only of sufferings from within, but also of those from without.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.3">Therefore those who gave over their bodies in suffering for the sake of religion were not only admired by men, but also were deemed worthy to share in a divine inheritance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.4">Because of them the nation gained peace, and by reviving observance of the law in the homeland they ravaged the enemy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.5">The tyrant Antiochus was both punished on earth and is being chastised after his death. Since in no way whatever was he able to compel the Israelites to become pagans and to abandon their ancestral customs, he left Jerusalem and marched against the Persians.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.6">The mother of seven sons expressed also these principles to her children:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.7">"I was a pure virgin and did not go outside my father's house; but I guarded the rib from which woman was made.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.8">No seducer corrupted me on a desert plain, nor did the destroyer, the deceitful serpent, defile the purity of my virginity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.9">In the time of my maturity I remained with my husband, and when these sons had grown up their father died. A happy man was he, who lived out his life with good children, and did not have the grief of bereavement.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.10">While he was still with you, he taught you the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.11">He read to you about Abel slain by Cain, and Isaac who was offered as a burnt offering, and of Joseph in prison.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.12">He told you of the zeal of Phineas, and he taught you about Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael in the fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.13">He praised Daniel in the den of the lions and blessed him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.14">He reminded you of the scripture of Isaiah, which says, `Even though you go through the fire, the flame shall not consume you.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.15">He sang to you songs of the psalmist David, who said, `Many are the afflictions of the righteous.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.16">He recounted to you Solomon's proverb, `There is a tree of life for those who do his will.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.17">He confirmed the saying of Ezekiel, `Shall these dry bones live?'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.18">For he did not forget to teach you the song that Moses taught, which says,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.19">`I kill and I make alive: this is your life and the length of your days.'"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.20">O bitter was that day -- and yet not bitter -- when that bitter tyrant of the Greeks quenched fire with fire in his cruel caldrons, and in his burning rage brought those seven sons of the daughter of Abraham to the catapult and back again to more tortures,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.21">pierced the pupils of their eyes and cut out their tongues, and put them to death with various tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.22">For these crimes divine justice pursued and will pursue the accursed tyrant.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.23">But the sons of Abraham with their victorious mother are gathered together into the chorus of the fathers, and have received pure and immortal souls from God,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.24">to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
