        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.2">Then Azariah stood and offered this prayer; in the midst of the fire he opened his mouth and said:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.3">"Blessed art thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and worthy of praise; and thy name is glorified for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.4">For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us, and all thy works are true and thy ways right, and all thy judgments are truth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.5">Thou hast executed true judgments in all that thou hast brought upon us and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers, for in truth and justice thou hast brought all this upon us because of our sins.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.6">For we have sinfully and lawlessly departed from thee, and have sinned in all things and have not obeyed thy commandments;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.7">we have not observed them or done them, as thou hast commanded us that it might go well with us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.8">So all that thou hast brought upon us, and all that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.9">Thou hast given us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful rebels, and to an unjust king, the most wicked in all the world.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.10">And now we cannot open our mouths; shame and disgrace have befallen thy servants and worshipers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.11">For thy name's sake do not give us up utterly, and do not break thy covenant,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.12">and do not withdraw thy mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham thy beloved and for the sake of Isaac thy servant and Israel thy holy one,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.13">to whom thou didst promise to make their descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the sand on the shore of the sea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.14">For we, O Lord, have become fewer than any nation, and are brought low this day in all the world because of our sins.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.15">And at this time there is no prince, or prophet, or leader, no burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, no place to make an offering before thee or to find mercy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.16">Yet with a contrite heart and a humble spirit may we be accepted, as though it were with burnt offerings of rams and bulls, and with tens of thousands of fat lambs;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.17">such may our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and may we wholly follow thee, for there will be no shame for those who trust in thee.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.18">And now with all our heart we follow thee, we fear thee and seek thy face.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.19">Do not put us to shame, but deal with us in thy forbearance and in thy abundant mercy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.20">Deliver us in accordance with thy marvelous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord! Let all who do harm to thy servants be put to shame;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.21">let them be disgraced and deprived of all power and dominion, and let their strength be broken.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.22">Let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God, glorious over the whole world."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.23">Now the king's servants who threw them in did not cease feeding the furnace fires with naphtha, pitch, tow, and brush.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.24">And the flame streamed out above the furnace forty-nine cubits,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.25">and it broke through and burned those of the Chaldeans whom it caught about the furnace.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.26">But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace to be with Azariah and his companions, and drove the fiery flame out of the furnace,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.27">and made the midst of the furnace like a moist whistling wind, so that the fire did not touch them at all or hurt or trouble them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.28">Then the three, as with one mouth, praised and glorified and blessed God in the furnace, saying:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.29">"Blessed art thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and to be praised and highly exalted for ever;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.30">And blessed is thy glorious, holy name and to be highly praised and highly exalted for ever;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.31">Blessed art thou in the temple of thy holy glory and to be extolled and highly glorified for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.32">Blessed art thou, who sittest upon cherubim and lookest upon the deeps, and to be praised and highly exalted for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.33">Blessed art thou upon the throne of thy kingdom and to be extolled and highly exalted for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.34">Blessed art thou in the firmament of heavenand to be sung and glorified for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.35">"Bless the Lord, all works of the Lord, sing praise to him and highly exalt him for ever.</verse>
