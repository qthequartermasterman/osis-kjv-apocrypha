        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.1">These are the words of the book which Baruch the son of Neraiah, son of Mahseiah, son of Zedekiah, son of Hasadiah, son of Hilkiah, wrote in Babylon,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.2">in the fifth year, on the seventh day of the month, at the time when the Chaldeans took Jerusalem and burned it with fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.3">And Baruch read the words of this book in the hearing of Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and in the hearing of all the people who came to hear the book,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.4">and in the hearing of the mighty men and the princes, and in the hearing of the elders, and in the hearing of all the people, small and great, all who dwelt in Babylon by the river Sud.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.5">Then they wept, and fasted, and prayed before the Lord;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.6">and they collected money, each giving what he could;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.7">and they sent it to Jerusalem to Jehoiakim the high priest, the son of Hilkiah, son of Shallum, and to the priests, and to all the people who were present with him in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.8">At the same time, on the tenth day of Sivan, Baruch took the vessels of the house of the Lord, which had been carried away from the temple, to return them to the land of Judah -- the silver vessels which Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, had made,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.9">after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away from Jerusalem Jeconiah and the princes and the prisoners and the mighty men and the people of the land, and brought them to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.10">And they said: "Herewith we send you money; so buy with the money burnt offerings and sin offerings and incense, and prepare a cereal offering, and offer them upon the altar of the Lord our God;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.11">and pray for the life of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and for the life of Belshazzar his son, that their days on earth may be like the days of heaven.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.12">And the Lord will give us strength, and he will give light to our eyes, and we shall live under the protection of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and under the protection of Belshazzar his son, and we shall serve them many days and find favor in their sight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.13">And pray for us to the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God, and to this day the anger of the Lord and his wrath have not turned away from us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.14">And you shall read this book which we are sending you, to make your confession in the house of the Lord on the days of the feasts and at appointed seasons.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.15">"And you shall say: `Righteousness belongs to the Lord our God, but confusion of face, as at this day, to us, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.17">because we have sinned before the Lord,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.18">and have disobeyed him, and have not heeded the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the statutes of the Lord which he set before us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.19">From the day when the Lord brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt until today, we have been disobedient to the Lord our God, and we have been negligent, in not heeding his voice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.20">So to this day there have clung to us the calamities and the curse which the Lord declared through Moses his servant at the time when he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt to give to us a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.21">We did not heed the voice of the Lord our God in all the words of the prophets whom he sent to us, but we each followed the intent of his own wicked heart by serving other gods and doing what is evil in the sight of the Lord our God.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.10">Yet we have not obeyed his voice, to walk in the statutes of the Lord which he set before us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.11">"`And now, O Lord God of Israel, who didst bring thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and with signs and wonders and with great power and outstretched arm, and hast made thee a name, as at this day,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.12">we have sinned, we have been ungodly, we have done wrong, O Lord our God, against all thy ordinances.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.14">Hear, O Lord, our prayer and our supplication, and for thy own sake deliver us, and grant us favor in the sight of those who have carried us into exile;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.15">that all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God, for Israel and his descendants are called by thy name.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.16">O Lord, look down from thy holy habitation, and consider us. Incline thy ear, O Lord, and hear;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.17">open thy eyes, O Lord, and see; for the dead who are in Hades, whose spirit has been taken from their bodies, will not ascribe glory or justice to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.18">but the person that is greatly distressed, that goes about bent over and feeble, and the eyes that are failing, and the person that hungers, will ascribe to thee glory and righteousness, O Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.19">For it is not because of any righteous deeds of our fathers or our kings that we bring before thee our prayer for mercy, O Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.20">For thou hast sent thy anger and thy wrath upon us, as thou didst declare by thy servants the prophets, saying:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.21">"Thus says the Lord: Bend your shoulders and serve the king of Babylon, and you will remain in the land which I gave to your fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.22">But if you will not obey the voice of the Lord and will not serve the king of Babylon,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.23">I will make to cease from the cities of Judah and from the region about Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, and the whole land will be a desolation without inhabitants."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.24">"`But we did not obey thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon; and thou hast confirmed thy words, which thou didst speak by thy servants the prophets, that the bones of our kings and the bones of our fathers would be brought out of their graves;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.25">and behold, they have been cast out to the heat of day and the frost of night. They perished in great misery, by famine and sword and pestilence.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.31">and they will know that I am the Lord their God. I will give them a heart that obeys and ears that hear;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.32">and they will praise me in the land of their exile, and will remember my name,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.33">and will turn from their stubbornness and their wicked deeds; for they will remember the ways of their fathers, who sinned before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.34">I will bring them again into the land which I swore to give to their fathers, to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob, and they will rule over it; and I will increase them, and they will not be diminished.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.2.35">I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God and they shall be my people; and I will never again remove my people Israel from the land which I have given them."</verse>
