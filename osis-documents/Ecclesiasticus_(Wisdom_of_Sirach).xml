        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.0.1-14">Whereas many great teachings have been given to us through the law and the prophets and the others that followed them, on account of which we should praise Israel for instruction and wisdom; and since it is necessary not only that the readers themselves should acquire understanding but also that those who love learning should be able to help the outsiders by both speaking and writing, my grandfather Jesus, after devoting himself especially to the reading of the law and the prophets and the other books of our fathers, and after acquiring considerable proficiency in them, was himself also led to write something pertaining to instruction and wisdom, in order that, by becoming conversant with this also, those who love learning should make even greater progress in living according to the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.0.15-26">You are urged therefore to read with good will and attention, and to be indulgent in cases where, despite out diligent labor in translating, we may seem to have rendered some phrases imperfectly. For what was originally expressed in Hebrew does not have exactly the same sense when translated into another language. Not only this work, but even the law itself, the prophecies, and the rest of the books differ not a little as originally expressed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.0.27-36">When I came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Euergetes and stayed for some time, I found opportunity for no little instruction. It seemed highly necessary that I should myself devote some pains and labor to the translation of the following book, using in that period of time great watchfulness and skill in order to complete and publish the book for those living abroad who wished to gain learning, being prepared in character to live according to the law.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.13">She made among men an eternal foundation, and among their descendants she will be trusted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.14">To fear the Lord is wisdom's full measure; she satisfies men with her fruits;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.16">The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.22">Unrighteous anger cannot be justified, for a man's anger tips the scale to his ruin.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.23">A patient man will endure until the right moment, and then joy will burst forth for him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.24">He will hide his words until the right moment, and the lips of many will tell of his good sense.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.25">In the treasuries of wisdom are wise sayings, but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.26">If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord will supply it for you.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.27">For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction, and he delights in fidelity and meekness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.28">Do not disobey the fear of the Lord; do not approach him with a divided mind.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.29">Be not a hypocrite in men's sight, and keep watch over your lips.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.1.30">Do not exalt yourself lest you fall, and thus bring dishonor upon yourself. The Lord will reveal your secrets and cast you down in the midst of the congregation, because you did not come in the fear of the Lord, and your heart was full of deceit.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.2.10">Consider the ancient generations and see: who ever trusted in the Lord and was put to shame? Or who ever persevered in the fear of the Lord and was forsaken? Or who ever called upon him and was overlooked?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.2.11">For the Lord is compassionate and merciful; he forgives sins and saves in time of affliction.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.2.12">Woe to timid hearts and to slack hands, and to the sinner who walks along two ways!</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.3.3">Whoever honors his father atones for sins,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.3.4">and whoever glorifies his mother is like one who lays up treasure.</verse>
