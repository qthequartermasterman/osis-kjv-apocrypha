        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.1">Josiah kept the passover to his Lord in Jerusalem; he killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.2">having placed the priests according to their divisions, arrayed in their garments, in the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.3">And he told the Levites, the temple servants of Israel, that they should sanctify themselves to the Lord and put the holy ark of the Lord in the house which Solomon the king, the son of David, had built;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.4">and he said, "You need no longer carry it upon your shoulders. Now worship the Lord your God and serve his people Israel; and prepare yourselves by your families and kindred,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.5">in accordance with the directions of David king of Israel and the magnificence of Solomon his son. Stand in order in the temple according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of you Levites, who minister before your brethren the people of Israel,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.6">and kill the passover lamb and prepare the sacrifices for your brethren, and keep the passover according to the commandment of the Lord which was given to Moses."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.7">And Josiah gave to the people who were present thirty thousand lambs and kids, and three thousand calves; these were given from the king's possessions, as he promised, to the people and the priests and Levites.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.8">And Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chief officers of the temple, gave to the priests for the passover two thousand six hundred sheep and three hundred calves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.9">And Jeconiah and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brother, and Hashabiah and Ochiel and Joram, captains over thousands, gave the Levites for the passover five thousand sheep and seven hundred calves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.10">And this is what took place. The priests and the Levites, properly arrayed and having the unleavened bread, stood according to kindred</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.11">and the grouping of the fathers' houses, before the people, to make the offering to the Lord as it is written in the book of Moses; this they did in the morning.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.12">They roasted the passover lamb with fire, as required; and they boiled the sacrifices in brass pots and caldrons, with a pleasing odor,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.13">and carried them to all the people. Afterward they prepared the passover for themselves and for their brethren the priests, the sons of Aaron,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.14">because the priests were offering the fat until night; so the Levites prepared it for themselves and for their brethren the priests, the sons of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.15">And the temple singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to the arrangement made by David, and also Asaph, Zechariah, and Eddinus, who represented the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.16">The gatekeepers were at each gate; no one needed to depart from his duties, for their brethren the Levites prepared the passover for them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.17">So the things that had to do with the sacrifices to the Lord were accomplished that day: the passover was kept</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.18">and the sacrifices were offered on the altar of the Lord, according to the command of King Josiah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.19">And the people of Israel who were present at that time kept the passover and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.20">No passover like it had been kept in Israel since the times of Samuel the prophet;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.21">none of the kings of Israel had kept such a passover as was kept by Josiah and the priests and Levites and the men of Judah and all of Israel who were dwelling in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.22">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this passover was kept.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.23">And the deeds of Josiah were upright in the sight of the Lord, for his heart was full of godliness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.24">The events of his reign have been recorded in the past, concerning those who sinned and acted wickedly toward the Lord beyond any other people or kingdom, and how they grieved the Lord deeply, so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.25">After all these acts of Josiah, it happened that Pharaoh, king of Egypt, went to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.26">And the king of Egypt sent word to him saying, "What have we to do with each other, king of Judea?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.27">I was not sent against you by the Lord God, for my war is at the Euphrates. And now the Lord is with me! The Lord is with me, urging me on! Stand aside, and do not oppose the Lord."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.28">But Josiah did not turn back to his chariot, but tried to fight with him, and did not heed the words of Jeremiah the prophet from the mouth of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.29">He joined battle with him in the plain of Megiddo, and the commanders came down against King Josiah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.30">And the king said to his servants, "Take me away from the battle, for I am very weak." And immediately his servants took him out of the line of battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.31">And he got into his second chariot; and after he was brought back to Jerusalem he died, and was buried in the tomb of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.32">And in all Judea they mourned for Josiah. Jeremiah the prophet lamented for Josiah, and the principal men, with the women, have made lamentation for him to this day; it was ordained that this should always be done throughout the whole nation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.33">These things are written in the book of the histories of the kings of Judea; and every one of the acts of Josiah, and his splendor, and his understanding of the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before and these that are now told, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.34">And the men of the nation took Jeconiah the son of Josiah, who was twenty-three years old, and made him king in succession to Josiah his father.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.35">And he reigned three months in Judah and Jerusalem. Then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.36">and fined the nation a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.37">And the king of Egypt made Jehoiakim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.38">Jehoiakim put the nobles in prison, and seized his brother Zarius and brought him up out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.39">Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign in Judea and Jerusalem, and he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.40">And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him with a chain of brass and took him away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.41">Nebuchadnezzar also took some holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and stored them in his temple in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.42">But the things that are reported about Jehoiakim and his uncleanness and impiety are written in the chronicles of the kings.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.43">Jehoiachin his son became king in his stead; when he was made king he was eighteen years old,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.44">and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.45">So after a year Nebuchadnezzar sent and removed him to Babylon, with the holy vessels of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.46">and made Zedekiah king of Judea and Jerusalem. Zedekiah was twenty-one years old, and he reigned eleven years.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.47">He also did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and did not heed the words that were spoken by Jeremiah the prophet from the mouth of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.48">And though King Nebuchadnezzar had made him swear by the name of the Lord, he broke his oath and rebelled; and he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart and transgressed the laws of the Lord, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.49">Even the leaders of the people and of the priests committed many acts of sacrilege and lawlessness beyond all the unclean deeds of all the nations, and polluted the temple of the Lord which had been hallowed in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.50">So the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he would have spared them and his dwelling place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.51">But they mocked his messengers, and whenever the Lord spoke, they scoffed at his prophets,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.52">until in his anger against his people because of their ungodly acts he gave command to bring against them the kings of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.53">These slew their young men with the sword around their holy temple, and did not spare young man or virgin, old man or child, for he gave them all into their hands.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.54">And all the holy vessels of the Lord, great and small, and the treasure chests of the Lord, and the royal stores, they took and carried away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.55">And they burned the house of the Lord and broke down the walls of Jerusalem and burned their towers with fire,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.56">and utterly destroyed all its glorious things. The survivors he led away to Babylon with the sword,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.57">and they were servants to him and to his sons until the Persians began to reign, in fulfilment of the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.58">"Until the land has enjoyed its sabbaths, it shall keep sabbath all the time of its desolation until the completion of seventy years."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Esd.2" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.1">In the first year of Cyrus as king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.2">the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.3">"Thus says Cyrus king of the Persians: The Lord of Israel, the Lord Most High, has made me king of the world,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.4">and he has commanded me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.5">If any one of you, therefore, is of his people, may his Lord be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord of Israel -- he is the Lord who dwells in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.6">and let each man, wherever he may live, be helped by the men of his place with gold and silver,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.7">with gifts and with horses and cattle, besides the other things added as votive offerings for the temple of the Lord which is in Jerusalem."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.8">Then arose the heads of families of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, and all whose spirit the Lord had stirred to go up to build the house in Jerusalem for the Lord;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.9">and their neighbors helped them with everything, with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with a very great number of votive offerings from many whose hearts were stirred.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.10">Cyrus the king also brought out the holy vessels of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and stored in his temple of idols.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.11">When Cyrus king of the Perians brought these out, he gave them to Mithridates his treasurer,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.12">and by him they were given to Sheshbazzar the governor of Judea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.13">The number of these was: a thousand gold cups, a thousand silver cups, twenty-nine silver censers, thirty gold bowls, two thousand four hundred and ten silver bowls, and a thousand other vessels.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.14">All the vessels were handed over, gold and silver, five thousand four hundred and sixty-nine,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.15">and they were carried back by Sheshbazzar with the returning exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.16">But in the time of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, Bishlam, Mithridates, Tabeel, Rehum, Beltethmus, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, living in Samaria and other places, wrote him the following letter, against those who were living in Judea and Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.17">"To King Artaxerxes our lord, Your servants Rehum the recorder and Shimshai the scribe and the other judges of their council in Coelesyria and Phoenicia:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.18">Now be it known to our lord the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have gone to Jerusalem and are building that rebellious and wicked city, repairing its market places and walls and laying the foundations for a temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.19">Now if this city is built and the walls finished, they will not only refuse to pay tribute but will even resist kings.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.20">And since the building of the temple is now going on, we think it best not to neglect such a matter,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.21">but to speak to our lord the king, in order that, if it seems good to you, search may be made in the records of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.22">You will find in the chronicles what has been written about them, and will learn that this city was rebellious, troubling both kings and other cities,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.23">and that the Jews were rebels and kept setting up blockades in it from of old. That is why this city was laid waste.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.24">Therefore we now make known to you, O lord and king, that if this city is built and its walls finished, you will no longer have access to Coelesyria and Phoenicia."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.25">Then the king, in reply to Rehum the recorder and Beltethmus and Shimshai the scribe and the others associated with them and living in Samaria and Syria and Phoenicia, wrote as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.26">"I have read the letter which you sent me. So I ordered search to be made, and it has been found that this city from of old has fought against kings,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.27">and that the men in it were given to rebellion and war, and that mighty and cruel kings ruled in Jerusalem and exacted tribute from Coelesyria and Phoenicia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.28">Therefore I have now issued orders to prevent these men from building the city and to take care that nothing more be done</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.29">and that such wicked proceedings go no further to the annoyance of kings."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.30">Then, when the letter from King Artaxerxes was read, Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their associates went in haste to Jerusalem, with horsemen and a multitude in battle array, and began to hinder the builders. And the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Esd.3" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.1">Now King Darius gave a great banquet for all that were under him and all that were born in his house and all the nobles of Media and Persia</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.2">and all the satraps and generals and governors that were under him in the hundred and twenty-seven satrapies from India to Ethiopia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.3">They ate and drank, and when they were satisfied they departed; and Darius the king went to his bedroom, and went to sleep, and then awoke.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.4">Then the three young men of the bodyguard, who kept guard over the person of the king, said to one another,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.5">"Let each of us state what one thing is strongest; and to him whose statement seems wisest, Darius the king will give rich gifts and great honors of victory.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.6">He shall be clothed in purple, and drink from gold cups, and sleep on a gold bed, and have a chariot with gold bridles, and a turban of fine linen, and a necklace about his neck;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.7">and because of his wisdom he shall sit next to Darius and shall be called kinsman of Darius."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.8">Then each wrote his own statement, and they sealed them and put them under the pillow of Darius the king,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.9">and said, "When the king wakes, they will give him the writing; and to the one whose statement the king and the three nobles of Persia judge to be wisest the victory shall be given according to what is written."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.10">The first wrote, "Wine is strongest."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.11">The second wrote, "The king is strongest."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.12">The third wrote, "Women are strongest, but truth is victor over all things."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.13">When the king awoke, they took the writing and gave it to him, and he read it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.14">Then he sent and summoned all the nobles of Persia and Media and the satraps and generals and governors and prefects,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.15">and he took his seat in the council chamber, and the writing was read in their presence.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.16">And he said, "Call the young men, and they shall explain their statements." So they were summoned, and came in.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.17">And they said to them, "Explain to us what you have written." Then the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine, began and said:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.18">"Gentlemen, how is wine the strongest? It leads astray the minds of all who drink it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.19">It makes equal the mind of the king and the orphan, of the slave and the free, of the poor and the rich.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.20">It turns every thought to feasting and mirth, and forgets all sorrow and debt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.21">It makes all hearts feel rich, forgets kings and satraps, and makes every one talk in millions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.22">When men drink they forget to be friendly with friends and brothers, and before long they draw their swords.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.23">And when they recover from the wine, they do not remember what they have done.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.24">Gentlemen, is not wine the strongest, since it forces men to do these things?" When he had said this, he stopped speaking.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Esd.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.1">Then the second, who had spoken of the strength of the king, began to speak:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.2">"Gentlemen, are not men strongest, who rule over land and sea and all that is in them?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.3">But the king is stronger; he is their lord and master, and whatever he says to them they obey.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.4">If he tells them to make war on one another, they do it; and if he sends them out against the enemy, they go, and conquer mountains, walls, and towers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.5">They kill and are killed, and do not disobey the king's command; if they win the victory, they bring everything to the king -- whatever spoil they take and everything else.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.6">Likewise those who do not serve in the army or make war but till the soil, whenever they sow, reap the harvest and bring some to the king; and they compel one another to pay taxes to the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.7">And yet he is only one man! If he tells them to kill, they kill; if he tells them to release, they release;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.8">if he tells them to attack, they attack; if he tells them to lay waste, they lay waste; if he tells them to build, they build;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.9">if he tells them to cut down, they cut down; if he tells them to plant, they plant.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.10">All his people and his armies obey him. Moreover, he reclines, he eats and drinks and sleeps,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.11">but they keep watch around him and no one may go away to attend to his own affairs, nor do they disobey him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.12">Gentlemen, why is not the king the strongest, since he is to be obeyed in this fashion?" And he stopped speaking.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.13">Then the third, that is Zerubbabel, who had spoken of women and truth, began to speak:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.14">Gentlemen, is not the king great, and are not men many, and is not wine strong? Who then is their master, or who is their lord? Is it not women?</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.8">"To King Darius, greeting. Let it be fully known to our lord the king that, when we went to the country of Judea and entered the city of Jerusalem, we found the elders of the Jews, who had been in captivity,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.9">building in the city of Jerusalem a great new house for the Lord, of hewn stone, with costly timber laid in the walls.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.10">These operations are going on rapidly, and the work is prospering in their hands and being completed with all splendor and care.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.11">Then we asked these elders, `At whose command are you building this house and laying the foundations of this structure?'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.12">And in order that we might inform you in writing who the leaders are, we questioned them and asked them for a list of the names of those who are at their head.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.13">They answered us, `We are the servants of the Lord who created the heaven and the earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.14">And the house was built many years ago by a king of Israel who was great and strong, and it was finished.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.15">But when our fathers sinned against the Lord of Israel who is in heaven, and provoked him, he gave them over into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of the Chaldeans;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.16">and they pulled down the house, and burned it, and carried the people away captive to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.17">But in the first year that Cyrus reigned over the country of Babylonia, King Cyrus wrote that this house should be rebuilt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.18">And the holy vessels of gold and of silver, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the house in Jerusalem and stored in his own temple, these Cyrus the king took out again from the temple in Babylon, and they were delivered to Zerubbabel and Sheshbazzar the governor</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.19">with the command that he should take all these vessels back and put them in the temple at Jerusalem, and that this temple of the Lord should be rebuilt on its site.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.20">Then this Sheshbazzar, after coming here, laid the foundations of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem, and although it has been in process of construction from that time until now, it has not yet reached completion.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.21">Now therefore, if it seems wise, O king, let search be made in the royal archives of our lord the king that are in Babylon;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.22">and if it is found that the building of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem was done with the consent of King Cyrus, and if it is approved by our lord the king, let him send us directions concerning these things."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.23">Then Darius commanded that search be made in the royal archives that were deposited in Babylon. And in Ecbatana, the fortress which is in the country of Media, a scroll was found in which this was recorded:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.24">"In the first year of the reign of Cyrus, King Cyrus ordered the building of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, where they sacrifice with perpetual fire;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.25">its height to be sixty cubits and its breadth sixty cubits, with three courses of hewn stone and one course of new native timber; the cost to be paid from the treasury of Cyrus the king;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.26">and that the holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both of gold and of silver, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the house in Jerusalem and carried away to Babylon, should be restored to the house in Jerusalem, to be placed where they had been."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.27">So Darius commanded Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, and their associates, and those who were appointed as local rulers in Syria and Phoenicia, to keep away from the place, and to permit Zerubbabel, the servant of the Lord and governor of Judea, and the elders of the Jews to build this house of the Lord on its site.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.28">"And I command that it be built completely, and that full effort be made to help the men who have returned from the captivity of Judea, until the house of the Lord is finished;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.29">and that out of the tribute of Coelesyria and Phoenicia a portion be scrupulously given to these men, that is, to Zerubbabel the governor, for sacrifices to the Lord, for bulls and rams and lambs,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.30">and likewise wheat and salt and wine and oil, regularly every year, without quibbling, for daily use as the priests in Jerusalem may indicate,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.31">in order that libations may be made to the Most High God for the king and his children, and prayers be offered for their life."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.32">And he commanded that if any should transgress or nullify any of the things herein written, a beam should be taken out of his house and he should be hanged upon it, and his property should be forfeited to the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.33">"Therefore may the Lord, whose name is there called upon, destroy every king and nation that shall stretch out their hands to hinder or damage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.34">"I, King Darius, have decreed that it be done with all diligence as here prescribed."</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.1">Then Sisinnes the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, and their associates, following the orders of King Darius,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.2">supervised the holy work with very great care, assisting the elders of the Jews and the chief officers of the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.3">And the holy work prospered, while the prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesied;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.4">and they completed it by the command of the Lord God of Israel. So with the consent of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of the Persians,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.5">the holy house was finished by the twenty-third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of King Darius.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.6">And the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of those from the captivity who joined them, did according to what was written in the book of Moses.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.7">They offered at the dedication of the temple of the Lord one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.9">and the priests and the Levites stood arrayed in their garments, according to kindred, for the services of the Lord God of Israel in accordance with the book of Moses; and the gatekeepers were at each gate.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.10">The people of Israel who came from the captivity kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, after the priests and the Levites were purified together.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.11">Not all of the returned captives were purified, but the Levites were all purified together,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.12">and they sacrificed the passover lamb for all the returned captives and for their brethren the priests and for themselves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.13">And the people of Israel who came from the captivity ate it, all those who had separated themselves from the abominations of the peoples of the land and sought the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.14">And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, rejoicing before the Lord,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.15">Because he had changed the will of the king of the Assyrians concerning them, to strengthen their hands for the service of the Lord God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.7">For Ezra possessed great knowledge, so that he omitted nothing from the law of the Lord or the commandments, but taught all Israel all the ordinances and judgments.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.8">The following is a copy of the written commission from Artaxerxes the king which was delivered to Ezra the priest and reader of the law of the Lord:</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.41">I assembled them at the river called Theras, and we encamped there three days, and I inspected them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.42">When I found there none of the sons of the priests or of the Levites,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.43">I sent word to Eliezar, Iduel, Maasmas,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.44">Elnathan, Shemaiah, Jarib, Nathan, Elnathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leaders and men of understanding;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.46">and ordered them to tell Iddo and his brethren and the treasurers at that place to send us men to serve as priests in the house of our Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.47">And by the mighty hand of our Lord they brought us competent men of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen, eighteen;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.48">also Hashabiah and Annunus and Jeshaiah his brother, of the sons of Hananiah, and their sons, twenty men;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.49">and of the temple servants, whom David and the leaders had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty temple servants; the list of all their names was reported.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.50">There I proclaimed a fast for the young men before our Lord, to seek from him a prosperous journey for ourselves and for our children and the cattle that were with us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.51">For I was ashamed to ask the king for foot soldiers and horsemen and an escort to keep us safe from our adversaries;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.52">for we had said to the king, "The power of our Lord will be with those who seek him, and will support them in every way."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.53">And again we prayed to our Lord about these things, and we found him very merciful.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.54">Then I set apart twelve of the leaders of the priests, Sherebiah and Hashabiah, and ten of their kinsmen with them;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.55">and I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which the king himself and his counselors and the nobles and all Israel had given.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.56">I weighed and gave to them six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels worth a hundred talents, and a hundred talents of gold,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.57">and twenty golden bowls, and twelve bronze vessels of fine bronze that glittered like gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.58">And I said to them, "You are holy to the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are vowed to the Lord, the Lord of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.59">Be watchful and on guard until you deliver them to the leaders of the priests and the Levites, and to the heads of the fathers' houses of Israel, in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of our Lord."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.60">So the priests and the Levites who took the silver and the gold and the vessels which had been in Jerusalem carried them to the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.61">We departed from the river Theras on the twelfth day of the first month; and we arrived in Jerusalem by the mighty hand of our Lord which was upon us; he delivered us from every enemy on the way, and so we came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.62">When we had been there three days, the silver and the gold were weighed and delivered in the house of our Lord to Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.64">The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded at that very time.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.65">And those who had come back from captivity offered sacrifices to the Lord, the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.66">seventy-two lambs, and as a thank offering twelve he-goats -- all as a sacrifice to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.67">And they delivered the king's orders to the royal stewards and to the governors of Coelesyria and Phoenicia; and these officials honored the people and the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.68">After these things had been done, the principal men came to me and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.69">"The people of Israel and the leaders and the priests and the Levites have not put away from themselves the alien peoples of the land and their pollutions, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Edomites.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.70">For they and their sons have married the daughters of these people, and the holy race has been mixed with the alien peoples of the land; and from the beginning of this matter the leaders and the nobles have been sharing in this iniquity."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.71">As soon as I heard these things I rent my garments and my holy mantle, and pulled out hair from my head and beard, and sat down in anxiety and grief.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.72">And all who were ever moved at the word of the Lord of Israel gathered round me, as I mourned over this iniquity, and I sat grief-stricken until the evening sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.73">Then I rose from my fast, with my garments and my holy mantle rent, and kneeling down and stretching forth my hands to the Lord</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.74">I said, "O Lord, I am ashamed and confounded before thy face.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.75">For our sins have risen higher than our heads, and our mistakes have mounted up to heaven</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.77">And because of our sins and the sins of our fathers we with our brethren and our kings and our priests were given over to the kings of the earth, to the sword and captivity and plundering, in shame until this day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.78">And now in some measure mercy has come to us from thee, O Lord, to leave to us a root and a name in thy holy place,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.79">and to uncover a light for us in the house of the Lord our God, and to give us food in the time of our servitude.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.80">Even in our bondage we were not forsaken by our Lord, but he brought us into favor with the kings of the Persians, so that they have given us food</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.81">and glorified the temple of our Lord, and raised Zion from desolation, to give us a stronghold in Judea and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.82">"And now, O Lord, what shall we say, when we have these things? For we have transgressed thy commandments, which thou didst give by thy servants the prophets, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.83">`The land which you are entering to take possession of it is a land polluted with the pollution of the aliens of the land, and they have filled it with their uncleanness.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.86">And all that has happened to us has come about because of our evil deeds and our great sins. For thou, O Lord, didst lift the burden of our sins</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.87">and give us such a root as this; but we turned back again to transgress thy law by mixing with the uncleanness of the peoples of the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.88">Wast thou not angry enough with us to destroy us without leaving a root or seed or name?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.89">O Lord of Israel, thou art true; for we are left as a root to this day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.90">Behold, we are now before thee in our iniquities; for we can no longer stand in thy presence because of these things."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.91">While Ezra was praying and making his confession, weeping and lying upon the ground before the temple, there gathered about him a very great throng from Jerusalem, men and women and youths; for there was great weeping among the multitude.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.92">Then Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the men of Israel, called out, and said to Ezra, "We have sinned against the Lord, and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land; but even now there is hope for Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.93">Let us take an oath to the Lord about this, that we will put away all our foreign wives, with their children,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.94">as seems good to you and to all who obey the law of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.95">Arise and take action, for it is your task, and we are with you to take strong measures."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.96">Then Ezra arose and had the leaders of the priests and Levites of all Israel take oath that they would do this. And they took the oath.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.1">Then Ezra rose and went from the court of the temple to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.2">and spent the night there; and he did not eat bread or drink water, for he was mourning over the great iniquities of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.3">And a proclamation was made throughout Judea and Jerusalem to all who had returned from the captivity that they should assemble at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.4">and that if any did not meet there within two or three days, in accordance with the decision of the ruling elders, their cattle should be seized for sacrifice and the men themselves expelled from the multitude of those who had returned from the captivity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.5">Then the men of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within three days; this was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.10">Then all the multitude shouted and said with a loud voice, "We will do as you have said.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.11">But the multitude is great and it is winter, and we are not able to stand in the open air. This is not a work we can do in one day or two, for we have sinned too much in these things.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.12">so let the leaders of the multitude stay, and let all those in our settlements who have foreign wives come at the time appointed,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.13">with the elders and judges of each place, until we are freed from the wrath of the Lord over this matter."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.14">Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah undertook the matter on these terms, and Meshullam and Levi and Shabbethai served with them as judges.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.37">The priests and the Levites and the men of Israel settled in Jerusalem and in the country. On the new moon of the seventh month, when the sons of Israel were in their settlements,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.38">the whole multitude gathered with one accord into the open square before the east gate of the temple;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.39">and they told Ezra the chief priest and reader to bring the law of Moses which had been given by the Lord God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.45">Then Ezra took up the book of the law in the sight of the multitude, for he had the place of honor in the presence of all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.46">And when he opened the law, they all stood erect. And Ezra blessed the Lord God Most High, the God of hosts, the Almighty;</verse>
