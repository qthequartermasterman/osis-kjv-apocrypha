        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.1">Love righteousness, you rulers of the earth, think of the Lord with uprightness, and seek him with sincerity of heart;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.2">because he is found by those who do not put him to the test, and manifests himself to those who do not distrust him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.3">For perverse thoughts separate men from God, and when his power is tested, it convicts the foolish;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.4">because wisdom will not enter a deceitful soul, nor dwell in a body enslaved to sin.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.5">For a holy and disciplined spirit will flee from deceit, and will rise and depart from foolish thoughts, and will be ashamed at the approach of unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.6">For wisdom is a kindly spirit and will not free a blasphemer from the guilt of his words; because God is witness of his inmost feelings, and a true observer of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.7">Because the Spirit of the Lord has filled the world, and that which holds all things together knows what is said;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.8">therefore no one who utters unrighteous things will escape notice, and justice, when it punishes, will not pass him by.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.9">For inquiry will be made into the counsels of an ungodly man, and a report of his words will come to the Lord, to convict him of his lawless deeds;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.10">because a jealous ear hears all things, and the sound of murmurings does not go unheard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.11">Beware then of useless murmuring, and keep your tongue from slander; because no secret word is without result, and a lying mouth destroys the soul.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.12">Do not invite death by the error of your life, nor bring on destruction by the works of your hands;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.13">because God did not make death, and he does not delight in the death of the living.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.14">For he created all things that they might exist, and the generative forces of the world are wholesome, and there is no destructive poison in them; and the dominion of Hades is not on earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.15">For righteousness is immortal.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.16">But ungodly men by their words and deeds summoned death; considering him a friend, they pined away, and they made a covenant with him, because they are fit to belong to his party.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Wis.2" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.1">For they reasoned unsoundly, saying to themselves, Short and sorrowful is our life, and there is no remedy when a man comes to his end, and no one has been known to return from Hades.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.2">Because we were born by mere chance, and hereafter we shall be as though we had never been; because the breath in our nostrils is smoke, and reason is a spark kindled by the beating of our hearts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.3">When it is extinguished, the body will turn to ashes, and the spirit will dissolve like empty air.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.4">Our name will be forgotten in time and no one will remember our works; our life will pass away like the traces of a cloud, and be scattered like mist that is chased by the rays of the sun and overcome by its heat.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.5">For our allotted time is the passing of a shadow, and there is no return from our death, because it is sealed up and no one turns back.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.6">"Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that exist, and make use of the creation to the full as in youth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.7">Let us take our fill of costly wine and perfumes, and let no flower of spring pass by us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.8">Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.9">Let none of us fail to share in our revelry, everywhere let us leave signs of enjoyment, because this is our portion, and this our lot.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.10">Let us oppress the righteous poor man; let us not spare the widow nor regard the gray hairs of the aged.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.11">But let our might be our law of right, for what is weak proves itself to be useless.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.12">"Let us lie in wait for the righteous man, because he is inconvenient to us and opposes our actions; he reproaches us for sins against the law, and accuses us of sins against our training.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.13">He professes to have knowledge of God, and calls himself a child of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.14">He became to us a reproof of our thoughts;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.15">the very sight of him is a burden to us, because his manner of life is unlike that of others, and his ways are strange.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.16">We are considered by him as something base, and he avoids our ways as unclean; he calls the last end of the righteous happy, and boasts that God is his father.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.17">Let us see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen at the end of his life;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.18">for if the righteous man is God's son, he will help him, and will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.19">Let us test him with insult and torture, that we may find out how gentle he is, and make trial of his forbearance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.20">Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for, according to what he says, he will be protected."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.21">Thus they reasoned, but they were led astray, for their wickedness blinded them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.22">and they did not know the secret purposes of God, nor hope for the wages of holiness, nor discern the prize for blameless souls;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.23">for God created man for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.24">but through the devil's envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party experience it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Wis.3" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.1">But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.2">In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, and their departure was thought to be an affliction,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.3">and their going from us to be their destruction; but they are at peace.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.4">For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope is full of immortality.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.5">Having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good, because God tested them and found them worthy of himself;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.6">like gold in the furnace he tried them, and like a sacrificial burnt offering he accepted them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.7">In the time of their visitation they will shine forth, and will run like sparks through the stubble.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.8">They will govern nations and rule over peoples, and the Lord will reign over them for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.9">Those who trust in him will understand truth, and the faithful will abide with him in love, because grace and mercy are upon his elect, and he watches over his holy ones.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.10">But the ungodly will be punished as their reasoning deserves, who disregarded the righteous man and rebelled against the Lord;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.11">for whoever despises wisdom and instruction is miserable. Their hope is vain, their labors are unprofitable, and their works are useless.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.12">Their wives are foolish, and their children evil;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.13">their offspring are accursed. For blessed is the barren woman who is undefiled, who has not entered into a sinful union; she will have fruit when God examines souls.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.14">Blessed also is the eunuch whose hands have done no lawless deed, and who has not devised wicked things against the Lord; for special favor will be shown him for his faithfulness, and a place of great delight in the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.15">For the fruit of good labors is renowned, and the root of understanding does not fail.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.16">But children of adulterers will not come to maturity, and the offspring of an unlawful union will perish.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.17">Even if they live long they will be held of no account, and finally their old age will be without honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.18">If they die young, they will have no hope and no consolation in the day of decision.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.19">For the end of an unrighteous generation is grievous.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Wis.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.1">Better than this is childlessness with virtue, for in the memory of virtue is immortality, because it is known both by God and by men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.2">When it is present, men imitate it, and they long for it when it has gone; and throughout all time it marches crowned in triumph, victor in the contest for prizes that are undefiled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.3">But the prolific brood of the ungodly will be of no use, and none of their illegitimate seedlings will strike a deep root or take a firm hold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.4">For even if they put forth boughs for a while, standing insecurely they will be shaken by the wind, and by the violence of the winds they will be uprooted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.5">The branches will be broken off before they come to maturity, and their fruit will be useless, not ripe enough to eat, and good for nothing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.6">For children born of unlawful unions are witnesses of evil against their parents when God examines them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.7">But the righteous man, though he die early, will be at rest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.8">For old age is not honored for length of time, nor measured by number of years;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.9">but understanding is gray hair for men, and a blameless life is ripe old age.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.10">There was one who pleased God and was loved by him, and while living among sinners he was taken up.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.11">He was caught up lest evil change his understanding or guile deceive his soul.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.12">For the fascination of wickedness obscures what is good, and roving desire perverts the innocent mind.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.13">Being perfected in a short time, he fulfilled long years;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.14">for his soul was pleasing to the Lord, therefore he took him quickly from the midst of wickedness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.15">Yet the peoples saw and did not understand, nor take such a thing to heart, that God's grace and mercy are with his elect, and he watches over his holy ones.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.16">The righteous man who had died will condemn the ungodly who are living, and youth that is quickly perfected will condemn the prolonged old age of the unrighteous man.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.17">For they will see the end of the wise man, and will not understand what the Lord purposed for him, and for what he kept him safe.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.18">They will see, and will have contempt for him, but the Lord will laugh them to scorn. After this they will become dishonored corpses, and an outrage among the dead for ever;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.19">because he will dash them speechless to the ground, and shake them from the foundations; they will be left utterly dry and barren, and they will suffer anguish, and the memory of them will perish.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.20">They will come with dread when their sins are reckoned up, and their lawless deeds will convict them to their face.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Wis.5" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.1">Then the righteous man will stand with great confidence in the presence of those who have afflicted him, and those who make light of his labors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.2">When they see him, they will be shaken with dreadful fear, and they will be amazed at his unexpected salvation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.3">They will speak to one another in repentance, and in anguish of spirit they will groan, and say,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.4">"This is the man whom we once held in derision and made a byword of reproach -- we fools! We thought that his life was madness and that his end was without honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.5">Why has he been numbered among the sons of God? And why is his lot among the saints?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.6">So it was we who strayed from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness did not shine on us, and the sun did not rise upon us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.7">We took our fill of the paths of lawlessness and destruction, and we journeyed through trackless deserts, but the way of the Lord we have not known.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.8">What has our arrogance profited us? And what good has our boasted wealth brought us?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.9">"All those things have vanished like a shadow, and like a rumor that passes by;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.10">like a ship that sails through the billowy water, and when it has passed no trace can be found, nor track of its keel in the waves;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.11">or as, when a bird flies through the air, no evidence of its passage is found; the light air, lashed by the beat of its pinions and pierced by the force of its rushing flight, is traversed by the movement of its wings, and afterward no sign of its coming is found there;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.12">or as, when an arrow is shot at a target, the air, thus divided, comes together at once, so that no one knows its pathway.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.13">So we also, as soon as we were born, ceased to be, and we had no sign of virtue to show, but were consumed in our wickedness."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.14">Because the hope of the ungodly man is like chaff carried by the wind, and like a light hoarfrost driven away by a storm; it is dispersed like smoke before the wind, and it passes like the remembrance of a guest who stays but a day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.15">But the righteous live for ever, and their reward is with the Lord; the Most High takes care of them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.16">Therefore they will receive a glorious crown and a beautiful diadem from the hand of the Lord, because with his right hand he will cover them, and with his arm he will shield them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.17">The Lord will take his zeal as his whole armor, and will arm all creation to repel his enemies;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.18">he will put on righteousness as a breastplate, and wear impartial justice as a helmet;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.19">he will take holiness as an invincible shield,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.20">and sharpen stern wrath for a sword, and creation will join with him to fight against the madmen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.21">Shafts of lightning will fly with true aim, and will leap to the target as from a well-drawn bow of clouds,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.22">and hailstones full of wrath will be hurled as from a catapult; the water of the sea will rage against them, and rivers will relentlessly overwhelm them;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.23">a mighty wind will rise against them , and like a tempest it will winnow them away. Lawlessness will lay waste the whole earth, and evil-doing will overturn the thrones of rulers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Wis.6" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.1">Listen therefore, O kings, and understand; learn, O judges of the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.2">Give ear, you that rule over multitudes, and boast of many nations.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.3">For your dominion was given you from the Lord, and your sovereignty from the Most High, who will search out your works and inquire into your plans.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.4">Because as servants of his kingdom you did not rule rightly, nor keep the law, nor walk according to the purpose of God,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.5">he will come upon you terribly and swiftly, because severe judgment falls on those in high places.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.6">For the lowliest man may be pardoned in mercy, but mighty men will be mightily tested.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.7">For the Lord of all will not stand in awe of any one, nor show deference to greatness; because he himself made both small and great, and he takes thought for all alike.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.8">But a strict inquiry is in store for the mighty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.9">To you then, O monarchs, my words are directed, that you may learn wisdom and not transgress.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.10">For they will be made holy who observe holy things in holiness, and those who have been taught them will find a defense.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.11">Therefore set your desire on my words; long for them, and you will be instructed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.12">Wisdom is radiant and unfading, and she is easily discerned by those who love her, and is found by those who seek her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.13">She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.14">He who rises early to seek her will have no difficulty, for he will find her sitting at his gates.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.15">To fix one's thought on her is perfect understanding, and he who is vigilant on her account will soon be free from care,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.16">because she goes about seeking those worthy of her, and she graciously appears to them in their paths, and meets them in every thought.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.17">The beginning of wisdom is the most sincere desire for instruction, and concern for instruction is love of her,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.18">and love of her is the keeping of her laws, and giving heed to her laws is assurance of immortality,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.19">and immortality brings one near to God;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.20">so the desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.21">Therefore if you delight in thrones and scepters, O monarchs over the peoples, honor wisdom, that you may reign for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.22">I will tell you what wisdom is and how she came to be, and I will hide no secrets from you, but I will trace her course from the beginning of creation, and make knowledge of her clear, and I will not pass by the truth;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.23">neither will I travel in the company of sickly envy, for envy does not associate with wisdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.24">A multitude of wise men is the salvation of the world, and a sensible king is the stability of his people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.6.25">Therefore be instructed by my words, and you will profit.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.1">I also am mortal, like all men, a descendant of the first-formed child of earth; and in the womb of a mother I was molded into flesh,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.2">within the period of ten months, compacted with blood, from the seed of a man and the pleasure of marriage.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.3">And when I was born, I began to breathe the common air, and fell upon the kindred earth, and my first sound was a cry, like that of all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.4">I was nursed with care in swaddling cloths.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.5">For no king has had a different beginning of existence;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.6">there is for all mankind one entrance into life, and a common departure.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.7">Therefore I prayed, and understanding was given me; I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.8">I preferred her to scepters and thrones, and I accounted wealth as nothing in comparison with her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.9">Neither did I liken to her any priceless gem, because all gold is but a little sand in her sight, and silver will be accounted as clay before her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.10">I loved her more than health and beauty, and I chose to have her rather than light, because her radiance never ceases.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.11">All good things came to me along with her, and in her hands uncounted wealth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.12">I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom leads them; but I did not know that she was their mother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.13">I learned without guile and I impart without grudging; I do not hide her wealth,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.14">for it is an unfailing treasure for men; those who get it obtain friendship with God, commended for the gifts that come from instruction.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.20">the natures of animals and the tempers of wild beasts, the powers of spirits and the reasonings of men, the varieties of plants and the virtues of roots;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.21">I learned both what is secret and what is manifest,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.22">for wisdom, the fashioner of all things, taught me. For in her there is a spirit that is intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile, clear, unpolluted, distinct, invulnerable, loving the good, keen, irresistible,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.23">beneficent, humane, steadfast, sure, free from anxiety, all-powerful, overseeing all, and penetrating through all spirits that are intelligent and pure and most subtle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.24">For wisdom is more mobile than any motion; because of her pureness she pervades and penetrates all things.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.25">For she is a breath of the power of God, and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty; therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.26">For she is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of God, and an image of his goodness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.27">Though she is but one, she can do all things, and while remaining in herself, she renews all things; in every generation she passes into holy souls and makes them friends of God, and prophets;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.28">for God loves nothing so much as the man who lives with wisdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.29">For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.3">She glorifies her noble birth by living with God, and the Lord of all loves her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.4">For she is an initiate in the knowledge of God, and an associate in his works.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.7">And if any one loves righteousness, her labors are virtues; for she teaches self-control and prudence, justice and courage; nothing in life is more profitable for men than these.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.8">And if any one longs for wide experience, she knows the things of old, and infers the things to come; she understands turns of speech and the solutions of riddles; she has foreknowledge of signs and wonders and of the outcome of seasons and times.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.9">Therefore I determined to take her to live with me, knowing that she would give me good counsel and encouragement in cares and grief.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.15">dread monarchs will be afraid of me when they hear of me; among the people I shall show myself capable, and courageous in war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.16">When I enter my house, I shall find rest with her, for companionship with her has no bitterness, and life with her has no pain, but gladness and joy.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.18">and in friendship with her, pure delight, and in the labors of her hands, unfailing wealth, and in the experience of her company, understanding, and renown in sharing her words, I went about seeking how to get her for myself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.19">As a child I was by nature well endowed, and a good soul fell to my lot;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.21">But I perceived that I would not possess wisdom unless God gave her to me -- and it was a mark of insight to know whose gift she was -- so I appealed to the Lord and besought him, and with my whole heart I said:</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.9.12">Then my works will be acceptable, and I shall judge thy people justly, and shall be worthy of the throne of my father.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.9.13">For what man can learn the counsel of God? Or who can discern what the Lord wills?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.9.14">For the reasoning of mortals is worthless, and our designs are likely to fail,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.9.15">for a perishable body weighs down the soul, and this earthy tent burdens the thoughtful mind.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.9.16">We can hardly guess at what is on earth, and what is at hand we find with labor; but who has traced out what is in the heavens?</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.3">But when an unrighteous man departed from her in his anger, he perished because in rage he slew his brother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.4">When the earth was flooded because of him, wisdom again saved it, steering the righteous man by a paltry piece of wood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.5">Wisdom also, when the nations in wicked agreement had been confounded, recognized the righteous man and preserved him blameless before God, and kept him strong in the face of his compassion for his child.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.6">Wisdom rescued a righteous man when the ungodly were perishing; he escaped the fire that descended on the Five Cities.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.8">For because they passed wisdom by, they not only were hindered from recognizing the good, but also left for mankind a reminder of their folly, so that their failures could never go unnoticed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.9">Wisdom rescued from troubles those who served her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.10">When a righteous man fled from his brother's wrath, she guided him on straight paths; she showed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of angels; she prospered him in his labors, and increased the fruit of his toil.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.11">When his oppressors were covetous, she stood by him and made him rich.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.12">She protected him from his enemies, and kept him safe from those who lay in wait for him; in his arduous contest she gave him the victory, so that he might learn that godliness is more powerful than anything.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.13">When a righteous man was sold, wisdom did not desert him, but delivered him from sin. She descended with him into the dungeon,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.14">and when he was in prison she did not leave him, until she brought him the scepter of a kingdom and authority over his masters. Those who accused him she showed to be false, and she gave him everlasting honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.15">A holy people and blameless race wisdom delivered from a nation of oppressors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.16">She entered the soul of a servant of the Lord, and withstood dread kings with wonders and signs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.17">She gave holy men the reward of their labors; she guided them along a marvelous way, and became a shelter to them by day, and a starry flame through the night.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.18">She brought them over the Red Sea, and led them through deep waters;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.20">Therefore the righteous plundered the ungodly; they sang hymns, O Lord, to thy holy name, and praised with one accord thy defending hand,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.11.12">for a twofold grief possessed them, and a groaning at the memory of what had occurred.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.11.13">For when they heard that through their own punishments the righteous had received benefit, they perceived it was the Lord's doing.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.11.17">For thy all-powerful hand, which created the world out of formless matter, did not lack the means to send upon them a multitude of bears, or bold lions,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.1">Again, one preparing to sail and about to voyage over raging waves calls upon a piece of wood more fragile than the ship which carries him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.2">For it was desire for gain that planned that vessel, and wisdom was the craftsman who built it;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.3">but it is thy providence, O Father, that steers its course, because thou hast given it a path in the sea, and a safe way through the waves,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.4">showing that thou canst save from every danger, so that even if a man lacks skill, he may put to sea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.5">It is thy will that works of thy wisdom should not be without effect; therefore men trust their lives even to the smallest piece of wood, and passing through the billows on a raft they come safely to land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.6">For even in the beginning, when arrogant giants were perishing, the hope of the world took refuge on a raft, and guided by thy hand left to the world the seed of a new generation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.7">For blessed is the wood by which righteousness comes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.8">But the idol made with hands is accursed, and so is he who made it; because he did the work, and the perishable thing was named a god.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.9">For equally hateful to God are the ungodly man and his ungodliness,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.10">for what was done will be punished together with him who did it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.11">Therefore there will be a visitation also upon the heathen idols, because, though part of what God created, they became an abomination, and became traps for the souls of men and a snare to the feet of the foolish.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.12">For the idea of making idols was the beginning of fornication, and the invention of them was the corruption of life,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.13">for neither have they existed from the beginning nor will they exist for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.14">For through the vanity of men they entered the world, and therefore their speedy end has been planned.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.15">For a father, consumed with grief at an untimely bereavement, made an image of his child, who had been suddenly taken from him; and he now honored as a god what was once a dead human being, and handed on to his dependents secret rites and initiations.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.16">Then the ungodly custom, grown strong with time, was kept as a law, and at the command of monarchs graven images were worshiped.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.17">When men could not honor monarchs in their presence, since they lived at a distance, they imagined their appearance far away, and made a visible image of the king whom they honored, so that by their zeal they might flatter the absent one as though present.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.18">Then the ambition of the craftsman impelled even those who did not know the king to intensify their worship.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.19">For he, perhaps wishing to please his ruler, skilfully forced the likeness to take more beautiful form,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.20">and the multitude, attracted by the charm of his work, now regarded as an object of worship the one whom shortly before they had honored as a man.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.21">And this became a hidden trap for mankind, because men, in bondage to misfortune or to royal authority, bestowed on objects of stone or wood the name that ought not to be shared.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.22">Afterward it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of God, but they live in great strife due to ignorance, and they call such great evils peace.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.23">For whether they kill children in their initiations, or celebrate secret mysteries, or hold frenzied revels with strange customs,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.24">they no longer keep either their lives or their marriages pure, but they either treacherously kill one another, or grieve one another by adultery,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.25">and all is a raging riot of blood and murder, theft and deceit, corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.27">For the worship of idols not to be named is the beginning and cause and end of every evil.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.28">For their worshipers either rave in exultation, or prophesy lies, or live unrighteously, or readily commit perjury;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.29">for because they trust in lifeless idols they swear wicked oaths and expect to suffer no harm.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.30">But just penalties will overtake them on two counts: because they thought wickedly of God in devoting themselves to idols, and because in deceit they swore unrighteously through contempt for holiness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.31">For it is not the power of the things by which men swear, but the just penalty for those who sin, that always pursues the transgression of the unrighteous.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.8">With misspent toil, he forms a futile god from the same clay -- this man who was made of earth a short time before and after a little while goes to the earth from which he was taken, when he is required to return the soul that was lent him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.9">But he is not concerned that he is destined to die or that his life is brief, but he competes with workers in gold and silver, and imitates workers in copper; and he counts it his glory that he molds counterfeit gods.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.10">His heart is ashes, his hope is cheaper than dirt, and his life is of less worth than clay,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.11">because he failed to know the one who formed him and inspired him with an active soul and breathed into him a living spirit.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.12">But he considered our existence an idle game, and life a festival held for profit, for he says one must get money however one can, even by base means.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.13">For this man, more than all others, knows that he sins when he makes from earthy matter fragile vessels and graven images.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.14">But most foolish, and more miserable than an infant, are all the enemies who oppressed thy people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.15">For they thought that all their heathen idols were gods, though these have neither the use of their eyes to see with, nor nostrils with which to draw breath, nor ears with which to hear, nor fingers to feel with, and their feet are of no use for walking.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.16">For a man made them, and one whose spirit is borrowed formed them; for no man can form a god which is like himself.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.3">in order that those men, when they desired food, might lose the least remnant of appetite because of the odious creatures sent to them, while thy people, after suffering want a short time, might partake of delicacies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.4">For it was necessary that upon those oppressors inexorable want should come, while to these it was merely shown how their enemies were being tormented.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.5">For when the terrible rage of wild beasts came upon thy people and they were being destroyed by the bites of writhing serpents, thy wrath did not continue to the end;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.9">For they were killed by the bites of locusts and flies, and no healing was found for them, because they deserved to be punished by such things;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.10">but thy sons were not conquered even by the teeth of venomous serpents, for thy mercy came to their help and healed them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.11">To remind them of thy oracles they were bitten, and then were quickly delivered, lest they should fall into deep forgetfulness and become unresponsive to thy kindness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.12">For neither herb nor poultice cured them, but it was thy word, O Lord, which heals all men.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.16">for the ungodly, refusing to know thee, were scourged by the strength of thy arm, pursued by unusual rains and hail and relentless storms, and utterly consumed by fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.17">For -- most incredible of all -- in the water, which quenches all things, the fire had still greater effect, for the universe defends the righteous.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.18">At one time the flame was restrained, so that it might not consume the creatures sent against the ungodly, but that seeing this they might know that they were being pursued by the judgment of God;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.19">and at another time even in the midst of water it burned more intensely than fire, to destroy the crops of the unrighteous land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.20">Instead of these things thou didst give thy people food of angels, and without their toil thou didst supply them from heaven with bread ready to eat, providing every pleasure and suited to every taste.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.21">For thy sustenance manifested thy sweetness toward thy children; and the bread, ministering to the desire of the one who took it, was changed to suit every one's liking.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.22">Snow and ice withstood fire without melting, so that they might know that the crops of their enemies were being destroyed by the fire that blazed in the hail and flashed in the showers of rain;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.23">whereas the fire, in order that the righteous might be fed, even forgot its native power.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.24">For creation, serving thee who hast made it, exerts itself to punish the unrighteous, and in kindness relaxes on behalf of those who trust in thee.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.16.25">Therefore at that time also, changed into all forms, it served thy all-nourishing bounty, according to the desire of those who had need,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.3">For thinking that in their secret sins they were unobserved behind a dark curtain of forgetfulness, they were scattered, terribly alarmed, and appalled by specters.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.6">Nothing was shining through to them except a dreadful, self-kindled fire, and in terror they deemed the things which they saw to be worse than that unseen appearance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.7">The delusions of their magic art lay humbled, and their boasted wisdom was scornfully rebuked.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.8">For those who promised to drive off the fears and disorders of a sick soul were sick themselves with ridiculous fear.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.9">For even if nothing disturbing frightened them, yet, scared by the passing of beasts and the hissing of serpents,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.10">they perished in trembling fear, refusing to look even at the air, though it nowhere could be avoided.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.11">For wickedness is a cowardly thing, condemned by its own testimony; distressed by conscience, it has always exaggerated the difficulties.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.14">But throughout the night, which was really powerless, and which beset them from the recesses of powerless Hades, they all slept the same sleep,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.15">and now were driven by monstrous specters, and now were paralyzed by their souls' surrender, for sudden and unexpected fear overwhelmed them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.16">And whoever was there fell down, and thus was kept shut up in a prison not made of iron;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.17.17">for whether he was a farmer or a shepherd or a workman who toiled in the wilderness, he was seized, and endured the inescapable fate; for with one chain of darkness they all were bound.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.9">For they ranged like horses, and leaped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who didst deliver them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.10">For they still recalled the events of their sojourn, how instead of producing animals the earth brought forth gnats, and instead of fish the river spewed out vast numbers of frogs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.11">Afterward they saw also a new kind of birds, when desire led them to ask for luxurious food;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.12">for, to give them relief, quails came up from the sea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.13">The punishments did not come upon the sinners without prior signs in the violence of thunder, for they justly suffered because of their wicked acts; for they practiced a more bitter hatred of strangers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.14">Others had refused to receive strangers when they came to them, but these made slaves of guests who were their benefactors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.15">And not only so, but punishment of some sort will come upon the former for their hostile reception of the aliens;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.16">but the latter, after receiving them with festal celebrations, afflicted with terrible sufferings those who had already shared the same rights.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.17">They were stricken also with loss of sight -- just as were those at the door of the righteous man --when, surrounded by yawning darkness, each tried to find the way through his own door.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.18">For the elements changed places with one another, as on a harp the notes vary the nature of the rhythm, while each note remains the same. This may be clearly inferred from the sight of what took place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.19">For land animals were transformed into water creatures, and creatures that swim moved over to the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.20">Fire even in water retained its normal power, and water forgot its fire-quenching nature.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.21">Flames, on the contrary, failed to consume the flesh of perishable creatures that walked among them, nor did they melt the crystalline, easily melted kind of heavenly food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.22">For in everything, O Lord, thou hast exalted and glorified thy people; and thou hast not neglected to help them at all times and in all places.</verse>
