        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.1">Josiah kept the passover to his Lord in Jerusalem; he killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.2">having placed the priests according to their divisions, arrayed in their garments, in the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.3">And he told the Levites, the temple servants of Israel, that they should sanctify themselves to the Lord and put the holy ark of the Lord in the house which Solomon the king, the son of David, had built;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.4">and he said, "You need no longer carry it upon your shoulders. Now worship the Lord your God and serve his people Israel; and prepare yourselves by your families and kindred,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.5">in accordance with the directions of David king of Israel and the magnificence of Solomon his son. Stand in order in the temple according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of you Levites, who minister before your brethren the people of Israel,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.6">and kill the passover lamb and prepare the sacrifices for your brethren, and keep the passover according to the commandment of the Lord which was given to Moses."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.7">And Josiah gave to the people who were present thirty thousand lambs and kids, and three thousand calves; these were given from the king's possessions, as he promised, to the people and the priests and Levites.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.8">And Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chief officers of the temple, gave to the priests for the passover two thousand six hundred sheep and three hundred calves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.9">And Jeconiah and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brother, and Hashabiah and Ochiel and Joram, captains over thousands, gave the Levites for the passover five thousand sheep and seven hundred calves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.10">And this is what took place. The priests and the Levites, properly arrayed and having the unleavened bread, stood according to kindred</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.11">and the grouping of the fathers' houses, before the people, to make the offering to the Lord as it is written in the book of Moses; this they did in the morning.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.12">They roasted the passover lamb with fire, as required; and they boiled the sacrifices in brass pots and caldrons, with a pleasing odor,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.13">and carried them to all the people. Afterward they prepared the passover for themselves and for their brethren the priests, the sons of Aaron,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.14">because the priests were offering the fat until night; so the Levites prepared it for themselves and for their brethren the priests, the sons of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.15">And the temple singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to the arrangement made by David, and also Asaph, Zechariah, and Eddinus, who represented the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.16">The gatekeepers were at each gate; no one needed to depart from his duties, for their brethren the Levites prepared the passover for them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.17">So the things that had to do with the sacrifices to the Lord were accomplished that day: the passover was kept</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.18">and the sacrifices were offered on the altar of the Lord, according to the command of King Josiah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.19">And the people of Israel who were present at that time kept the passover and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.20">No passover like it had been kept in Israel since the times of Samuel the prophet;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.21">none of the kings of Israel had kept such a passover as was kept by Josiah and the priests and Levites and the men of Judah and all of Israel who were dwelling in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.22">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this passover was kept.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.23">And the deeds of Josiah were upright in the sight of the Lord, for his heart was full of godliness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.24">The events of his reign have been recorded in the past, concerning those who sinned and acted wickedly toward the Lord beyond any other people or kingdom, and how they grieved the Lord deeply, so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.25">After all these acts of Josiah, it happened that Pharaoh, king of Egypt, went to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.26">And the king of Egypt sent word to him saying, "What have we to do with each other, king of Judea?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.27">I was not sent against you by the Lord God, for my war is at the Euphrates. And now the Lord is with me! The Lord is with me, urging me on! Stand aside, and do not oppose the Lord."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.28">But Josiah did not turn back to his chariot, but tried to fight with him, and did not heed the words of Jeremiah the prophet from the mouth of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.29">He joined battle with him in the plain of Megiddo, and the commanders came down against King Josiah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.30">And the king said to his servants, "Take me away from the battle, for I am very weak." And immediately his servants took him out of the line of battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.31">And he got into his second chariot; and after he was brought back to Jerusalem he died, and was buried in the tomb of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.32">And in all Judea they mourned for Josiah. Jeremiah the prophet lamented for Josiah, and the principal men, with the women, have made lamentation for him to this day; it was ordained that this should always be done throughout the whole nation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.33">These things are written in the book of the histories of the kings of Judea; and every one of the acts of Josiah, and his splendor, and his understanding of the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before and these that are now told, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.34">And the men of the nation took Jeconiah the son of Josiah, who was twenty-three years old, and made him king in succession to Josiah his father.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.35">And he reigned three months in Judah and Jerusalem. Then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.36">and fined the nation a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.37">And the king of Egypt made Jehoiakim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.38">Jehoiakim put the nobles in prison, and seized his brother Zarius and brought him up out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.39">Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign in Judea and Jerusalem, and he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.40">And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him with a chain of brass and took him away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.41">Nebuchadnezzar also took some holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and stored them in his temple in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.42">But the things that are reported about Jehoiakim and his uncleanness and impiety are written in the chronicles of the kings.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.43">Jehoiachin his son became king in his stead; when he was made king he was eighteen years old,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.44">and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.45">So after a year Nebuchadnezzar sent and removed him to Babylon, with the holy vessels of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.46">and made Zedekiah king of Judea and Jerusalem. Zedekiah was twenty-one years old, and he reigned eleven years.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.47">He also did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and did not heed the words that were spoken by Jeremiah the prophet from the mouth of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.48">And though King Nebuchadnezzar had made him swear by the name of the Lord, he broke his oath and rebelled; and he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart and transgressed the laws of the Lord, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.49">Even the leaders of the people and of the priests committed many acts of sacrilege and lawlessness beyond all the unclean deeds of all the nations, and polluted the temple of the Lord which had been hallowed in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.50">So the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he would have spared them and his dwelling place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.51">But they mocked his messengers, and whenever the Lord spoke, they scoffed at his prophets,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.52">until in his anger against his people because of their ungodly acts he gave command to bring against them the kings of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.53">These slew their young men with the sword around their holy temple, and did not spare young man or virgin, old man or child, for he gave them all into their hands.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.54">And all the holy vessels of the Lord, great and small, and the treasure chests of the Lord, and the royal stores, they took and carried away to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.55">And they burned the house of the Lord and broke down the walls of Jerusalem and burned their towers with fire,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.56">and utterly destroyed all its glorious things. The survivors he led away to Babylon with the sword,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.57">and they were servants to him and to his sons until the Persians began to reign, in fulfilment of the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.1.58">"Until the land has enjoyed its sabbaths, it shall keep sabbath all the time of its desolation until the completion of seventy years."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Esd.2" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.1">In the first year of Cyrus as king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.2">the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.3">"Thus says Cyrus king of the Persians: The Lord of Israel, the Lord Most High, has made me king of the world,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.4">and he has commanded me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.5">If any one of you, therefore, is of his people, may his Lord be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord of Israel -- he is the Lord who dwells in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.6">and let each man, wherever he may live, be helped by the men of his place with gold and silver,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.7">with gifts and with horses and cattle, besides the other things added as votive offerings for the temple of the Lord which is in Jerusalem."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.8">Then arose the heads of families of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, and all whose spirit the Lord had stirred to go up to build the house in Jerusalem for the Lord;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.9">and their neighbors helped them with everything, with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with a very great number of votive offerings from many whose hearts were stirred.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.10">Cyrus the king also brought out the holy vessels of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and stored in his temple of idols.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.11">When Cyrus king of the Perians brought these out, he gave them to Mithridates his treasurer,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.12">and by him they were given to Sheshbazzar the governor of Judea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.13">The number of these was: a thousand gold cups, a thousand silver cups, twenty-nine silver censers, thirty gold bowls, two thousand four hundred and ten silver bowls, and a thousand other vessels.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.14">All the vessels were handed over, gold and silver, five thousand four hundred and sixty-nine,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.15">and they were carried back by Sheshbazzar with the returning exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.16">But in the time of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, Bishlam, Mithridates, Tabeel, Rehum, Beltethmus, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, living in Samaria and other places, wrote him the following letter, against those who were living in Judea and Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.17">"To King Artaxerxes our lord, Your servants Rehum the recorder and Shimshai the scribe and the other judges of their council in Coelesyria and Phoenicia:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.18">Now be it known to our lord the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have gone to Jerusalem and are building that rebellious and wicked city, repairing its market places and walls and laying the foundations for a temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.19">Now if this city is built and the walls finished, they will not only refuse to pay tribute but will even resist kings.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.20">And since the building of the temple is now going on, we think it best not to neglect such a matter,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.21">but to speak to our lord the king, in order that, if it seems good to you, search may be made in the records of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.22">You will find in the chronicles what has been written about them, and will learn that this city was rebellious, troubling both kings and other cities,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.23">and that the Jews were rebels and kept setting up blockades in it from of old. That is why this city was laid waste.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.24">Therefore we now make known to you, O lord and king, that if this city is built and its walls finished, you will no longer have access to Coelesyria and Phoenicia."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.25">Then the king, in reply to Rehum the recorder and Beltethmus and Shimshai the scribe and the others associated with them and living in Samaria and Syria and Phoenicia, wrote as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.26">"I have read the letter which you sent me. So I ordered search to be made, and it has been found that this city from of old has fought against kings,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.27">and that the men in it were given to rebellion and war, and that mighty and cruel kings ruled in Jerusalem and exacted tribute from Coelesyria and Phoenicia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.28">Therefore I have now issued orders to prevent these men from building the city and to take care that nothing more be done</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.29">and that such wicked proceedings go no further to the annoyance of kings."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.2.30">Then, when the letter from King Artaxerxes was read, Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their associates went in haste to Jerusalem, with horsemen and a multitude in battle array, and began to hinder the builders. And the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Esd.3" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.1">Now King Darius gave a great banquet for all that were under him and all that were born in his house and all the nobles of Media and Persia</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.2">and all the satraps and generals and governors that were under him in the hundred and twenty-seven satrapies from India to Ethiopia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.3">They ate and drank, and when they were satisfied they departed; and Darius the king went to his bedroom, and went to sleep, and then awoke.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.4">Then the three young men of the bodyguard, who kept guard over the person of the king, said to one another,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.5">"Let each of us state what one thing is strongest; and to him whose statement seems wisest, Darius the king will give rich gifts and great honors of victory.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.6">He shall be clothed in purple, and drink from gold cups, and sleep on a gold bed, and have a chariot with gold bridles, and a turban of fine linen, and a necklace about his neck;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.7">and because of his wisdom he shall sit next to Darius and shall be called kinsman of Darius."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.8">Then each wrote his own statement, and they sealed them and put them under the pillow of Darius the king,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.9">and said, "When the king wakes, they will give him the writing; and to the one whose statement the king and the three nobles of Persia judge to be wisest the victory shall be given according to what is written."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.10">The first wrote, "Wine is strongest."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.11">The second wrote, "The king is strongest."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.12">The third wrote, "Women are strongest, but truth is victor over all things."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.13">When the king awoke, they took the writing and gave it to him, and he read it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.14">Then he sent and summoned all the nobles of Persia and Media and the satraps and generals and governors and prefects,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.15">and he took his seat in the council chamber, and the writing was read in their presence.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.16">And he said, "Call the young men, and they shall explain their statements." So they were summoned, and came in.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.17">And they said to them, "Explain to us what you have written." Then the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine, began and said:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.18">"Gentlemen, how is wine the strongest? It leads astray the minds of all who drink it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.19">It makes equal the mind of the king and the orphan, of the slave and the free, of the poor and the rich.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.20">It turns every thought to feasting and mirth, and forgets all sorrow and debt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.21">It makes all hearts feel rich, forgets kings and satraps, and makes every one talk in millions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.22">When men drink they forget to be friendly with friends and brothers, and before long they draw their swords.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.23">And when they recover from the wine, they do not remember what they have done.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.3.24">Gentlemen, is not wine the strongest, since it forces men to do these things?" When he had said this, he stopped speaking.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Esd.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.1">Then the second, who had spoken of the strength of the king, began to speak:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.2">"Gentlemen, are not men strongest, who rule over land and sea and all that is in them?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.3">But the king is stronger; he is their lord and master, and whatever he says to them they obey.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.4">If he tells them to make war on one another, they do it; and if he sends them out against the enemy, they go, and conquer mountains, walls, and towers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.5">They kill and are killed, and do not disobey the king's command; if they win the victory, they bring everything to the king -- whatever spoil they take and everything else.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.6">Likewise those who do not serve in the army or make war but till the soil, whenever they sow, reap the harvest and bring some to the king; and they compel one another to pay taxes to the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.7">And yet he is only one man! If he tells them to kill, they kill; if he tells them to release, they release;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.8">if he tells them to attack, they attack; if he tells them to lay waste, they lay waste; if he tells them to build, they build;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.9">if he tells them to cut down, they cut down; if he tells them to plant, they plant.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.10">All his people and his armies obey him. Moreover, he reclines, he eats and drinks and sleeps,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.11">but they keep watch around him and no one may go away to attend to his own affairs, nor do they disobey him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.12">Gentlemen, why is not the king the strongest, since he is to be obeyed in this fashion?" And he stopped speaking.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.13">Then the third, that is Zerubbabel, who had spoken of women and truth, began to speak:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.4.14">Gentlemen, is not the king great, and are not men many, and is not wine strong? Who then is their master, or who is their lord? Is it not women?</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.8">"To King Darius, greeting. Let it be fully known to our lord the king that, when we went to the country of Judea and entered the city of Jerusalem, we found the elders of the Jews, who had been in captivity,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.9">building in the city of Jerusalem a great new house for the Lord, of hewn stone, with costly timber laid in the walls.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.10">These operations are going on rapidly, and the work is prospering in their hands and being completed with all splendor and care.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.11">Then we asked these elders, `At whose command are you building this house and laying the foundations of this structure?'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.12">And in order that we might inform you in writing who the leaders are, we questioned them and asked them for a list of the names of those who are at their head.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.13">They answered us, `We are the servants of the Lord who created the heaven and the earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.14">And the house was built many years ago by a king of Israel who was great and strong, and it was finished.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.15">But when our fathers sinned against the Lord of Israel who is in heaven, and provoked him, he gave them over into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of the Chaldeans;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.16">and they pulled down the house, and burned it, and carried the people away captive to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.17">But in the first year that Cyrus reigned over the country of Babylonia, King Cyrus wrote that this house should be rebuilt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.18">And the holy vessels of gold and of silver, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the house in Jerusalem and stored in his own temple, these Cyrus the king took out again from the temple in Babylon, and they were delivered to Zerubbabel and Sheshbazzar the governor</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.19">with the command that he should take all these vessels back and put them in the temple at Jerusalem, and that this temple of the Lord should be rebuilt on its site.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.20">Then this Sheshbazzar, after coming here, laid the foundations of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem, and although it has been in process of construction from that time until now, it has not yet reached completion.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.21">Now therefore, if it seems wise, O king, let search be made in the royal archives of our lord the king that are in Babylon;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.22">and if it is found that the building of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem was done with the consent of King Cyrus, and if it is approved by our lord the king, let him send us directions concerning these things."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.23">Then Darius commanded that search be made in the royal archives that were deposited in Babylon. And in Ecbatana, the fortress which is in the country of Media, a scroll was found in which this was recorded:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.24">"In the first year of the reign of Cyrus, King Cyrus ordered the building of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, where they sacrifice with perpetual fire;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.25">its height to be sixty cubits and its breadth sixty cubits, with three courses of hewn stone and one course of new native timber; the cost to be paid from the treasury of Cyrus the king;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.26">and that the holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both of gold and of silver, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the house in Jerusalem and carried away to Babylon, should be restored to the house in Jerusalem, to be placed where they had been."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.27">So Darius commanded Sisinnes the governor of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, and their associates, and those who were appointed as local rulers in Syria and Phoenicia, to keep away from the place, and to permit Zerubbabel, the servant of the Lord and governor of Judea, and the elders of the Jews to build this house of the Lord on its site.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.28">"And I command that it be built completely, and that full effort be made to help the men who have returned from the captivity of Judea, until the house of the Lord is finished;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.29">and that out of the tribute of Coelesyria and Phoenicia a portion be scrupulously given to these men, that is, to Zerubbabel the governor, for sacrifices to the Lord, for bulls and rams and lambs,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.30">and likewise wheat and salt and wine and oil, regularly every year, without quibbling, for daily use as the priests in Jerusalem may indicate,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.31">in order that libations may be made to the Most High God for the king and his children, and prayers be offered for their life."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.32">And he commanded that if any should transgress or nullify any of the things herein written, a beam should be taken out of his house and he should be hanged upon it, and his property should be forfeited to the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.33">"Therefore may the Lord, whose name is there called upon, destroy every king and nation that shall stretch out their hands to hinder or damage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.6.34">"I, King Darius, have decreed that it be done with all diligence as here prescribed."</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.1">Then Sisinnes the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, and their associates, following the orders of King Darius,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.2">supervised the holy work with very great care, assisting the elders of the Jews and the chief officers of the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.3">And the holy work prospered, while the prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesied;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.4">and they completed it by the command of the Lord God of Israel. So with the consent of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of the Persians,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.5">the holy house was finished by the twenty-third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of King Darius.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.6">And the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of those from the captivity who joined them, did according to what was written in the book of Moses.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.7">They offered at the dedication of the temple of the Lord one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.9">and the priests and the Levites stood arrayed in their garments, according to kindred, for the services of the Lord God of Israel in accordance with the book of Moses; and the gatekeepers were at each gate.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.10">The people of Israel who came from the captivity kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, after the priests and the Levites were purified together.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.11">Not all of the returned captives were purified, but the Levites were all purified together,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.12">and they sacrificed the passover lamb for all the returned captives and for their brethren the priests and for themselves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.13">And the people of Israel who came from the captivity ate it, all those who had separated themselves from the abominations of the peoples of the land and sought the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.14">And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, rejoicing before the Lord,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.7.15">Because he had changed the will of the king of the Assyrians concerning them, to strengthen their hands for the service of the Lord God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.7">For Ezra possessed great knowledge, so that he omitted nothing from the law of the Lord or the commandments, but taught all Israel all the ordinances and judgments.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.8">The following is a copy of the written commission from Artaxerxes the king which was delivered to Ezra the priest and reader of the law of the Lord:</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.41">I assembled them at the river called Theras, and we encamped there three days, and I inspected them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.42">When I found there none of the sons of the priests or of the Levites,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.43">I sent word to Eliezar, Iduel, Maasmas,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.44">Elnathan, Shemaiah, Jarib, Nathan, Elnathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leaders and men of understanding;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.46">and ordered them to tell Iddo and his brethren and the treasurers at that place to send us men to serve as priests in the house of our Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.47">And by the mighty hand of our Lord they brought us competent men of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen, eighteen;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.48">also Hashabiah and Annunus and Jeshaiah his brother, of the sons of Hananiah, and their sons, twenty men;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.49">and of the temple servants, whom David and the leaders had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty temple servants; the list of all their names was reported.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.50">There I proclaimed a fast for the young men before our Lord, to seek from him a prosperous journey for ourselves and for our children and the cattle that were with us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.51">For I was ashamed to ask the king for foot soldiers and horsemen and an escort to keep us safe from our adversaries;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.52">for we had said to the king, "The power of our Lord will be with those who seek him, and will support them in every way."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.53">And again we prayed to our Lord about these things, and we found him very merciful.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.54">Then I set apart twelve of the leaders of the priests, Sherebiah and Hashabiah, and ten of their kinsmen with them;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.55">and I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which the king himself and his counselors and the nobles and all Israel had given.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.56">I weighed and gave to them six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels worth a hundred talents, and a hundred talents of gold,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.57">and twenty golden bowls, and twelve bronze vessels of fine bronze that glittered like gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.58">And I said to them, "You are holy to the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are vowed to the Lord, the Lord of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.59">Be watchful and on guard until you deliver them to the leaders of the priests and the Levites, and to the heads of the fathers' houses of Israel, in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of our Lord."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.60">So the priests and the Levites who took the silver and the gold and the vessels which had been in Jerusalem carried them to the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.61">We departed from the river Theras on the twelfth day of the first month; and we arrived in Jerusalem by the mighty hand of our Lord which was upon us; he delivered us from every enemy on the way, and so we came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.62">When we had been there three days, the silver and the gold were weighed and delivered in the house of our Lord to Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.64">The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded at that very time.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.65">And those who had come back from captivity offered sacrifices to the Lord, the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.66">seventy-two lambs, and as a thank offering twelve he-goats -- all as a sacrifice to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.67">And they delivered the king's orders to the royal stewards and to the governors of Coelesyria and Phoenicia; and these officials honored the people and the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.68">After these things had been done, the principal men came to me and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.69">"The people of Israel and the leaders and the priests and the Levites have not put away from themselves the alien peoples of the land and their pollutions, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Edomites.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.70">For they and their sons have married the daughters of these people, and the holy race has been mixed with the alien peoples of the land; and from the beginning of this matter the leaders and the nobles have been sharing in this iniquity."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.71">As soon as I heard these things I rent my garments and my holy mantle, and pulled out hair from my head and beard, and sat down in anxiety and grief.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.72">And all who were ever moved at the word of the Lord of Israel gathered round me, as I mourned over this iniquity, and I sat grief-stricken until the evening sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.73">Then I rose from my fast, with my garments and my holy mantle rent, and kneeling down and stretching forth my hands to the Lord</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.74">I said, "O Lord, I am ashamed and confounded before thy face.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.75">For our sins have risen higher than our heads, and our mistakes have mounted up to heaven</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.77">And because of our sins and the sins of our fathers we with our brethren and our kings and our priests were given over to the kings of the earth, to the sword and captivity and plundering, in shame until this day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.78">And now in some measure mercy has come to us from thee, O Lord, to leave to us a root and a name in thy holy place,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.79">and to uncover a light for us in the house of the Lord our God, and to give us food in the time of our servitude.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.80">Even in our bondage we were not forsaken by our Lord, but he brought us into favor with the kings of the Persians, so that they have given us food</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.81">and glorified the temple of our Lord, and raised Zion from desolation, to give us a stronghold in Judea and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.82">"And now, O Lord, what shall we say, when we have these things? For we have transgressed thy commandments, which thou didst give by thy servants the prophets, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.83">`The land which you are entering to take possession of it is a land polluted with the pollution of the aliens of the land, and they have filled it with their uncleanness.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.86">And all that has happened to us has come about because of our evil deeds and our great sins. For thou, O Lord, didst lift the burden of our sins</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.87">and give us such a root as this; but we turned back again to transgress thy law by mixing with the uncleanness of the peoples of the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.88">Wast thou not angry enough with us to destroy us without leaving a root or seed or name?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.89">O Lord of Israel, thou art true; for we are left as a root to this day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.90">Behold, we are now before thee in our iniquities; for we can no longer stand in thy presence because of these things."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.91">While Ezra was praying and making his confession, weeping and lying upon the ground before the temple, there gathered about him a very great throng from Jerusalem, men and women and youths; for there was great weeping among the multitude.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.92">Then Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the men of Israel, called out, and said to Ezra, "We have sinned against the Lord, and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land; but even now there is hope for Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.93">Let us take an oath to the Lord about this, that we will put away all our foreign wives, with their children,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.94">as seems good to you and to all who obey the law of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.95">Arise and take action, for it is your task, and we are with you to take strong measures."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.8.96">Then Ezra arose and had the leaders of the priests and Levites of all Israel take oath that they would do this. And they took the oath.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.1">Then Ezra rose and went from the court of the temple to the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.2">and spent the night there; and he did not eat bread or drink water, for he was mourning over the great iniquities of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.3">And a proclamation was made throughout Judea and Jerusalem to all who had returned from the captivity that they should assemble at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Esd.9.4">and that if any did not meet there within two or three days, in accordance with the decision of the ruling elders, their cattle should be seized for sacrifice and the men themselves expelled from the multitude of those who had returned from the captivity.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.1">After Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came from the land of Kittim, had defeated Darius, king of the Persians and the Medes, he succeeded him as king. (He had previously become king of Greece.)</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.2">He fought many battles, conquered strongholds, and put to death the kings of the earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.3">He advanced to the ends of the earth, and plundered many nations. When the earth became quiet before him, he was exalted, and his heart was lifted up.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.4">He gathered a very strong army and ruled over countries, nations, and princes, and they became tributary to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.5">After this he fell sick and perceived that he was dying.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.6">So he summoned his most honored officers, who had been brought up with him from youth, and divided his kingdom among them while he was still alive.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.7">And after Alexander had reigned twelve years, he died.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.8">Then his officers began to rule, each in his own place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.9">They all put on crowns after his death, and so did their sons after them for many years; and they caused many evils on the earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.10">From them came forth a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king; he had been a hostage in Rome. He began to reign in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.11">In those days lawless men came forth from Israel, and misled many, saying, "Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles round about us, for since we separated from them many evils have come upon us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.12">This proposal pleased them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.13">and some of the people eagerly went to the king. He authorized them to observe the ordinances of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.14">So they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, according to Gentile custom,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.15">and removed the marks of circumcision, and abandoned the holy covenant. They joined with the Gentiles and sold themselves to do evil.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.16">When Antiochus saw that his kingdom was established, he determined to become king of the land of Egypt, that he might reign over both kingdoms.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.17">So he invaded Egypt with a strong force, with chariots and elephants and cavalry and with a large fleet.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.18">He engaged Ptolemy king of Egypt in battle, and Ptolemy turned and fled before him, and many were wounded and fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.19">And they captured the fortified cities in the land of Egypt, and he plundered the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.20">After subduing Egypt, Antiochus returned in the one hundred and forty-third year. He went up against Israel and came to Jerusalem with a strong force.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.21">He arrogantly entered the sanctuary and took the golden altar, the lampstand for the light, and all its utensils.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.22">He took also the table for the bread of the Presence, the cups for drink offerings, the bowls, the golden censers, the curtain, the crowns, and the gold decoration on the front of the temple; he stripped it all off.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.23">He took the silver and the gold, and the costly vessels; he took also the hidden treasures which he found.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.24">Taking them all, he departed to his own land. He committed deeds of murder, and spoke with great arrogance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.25">Israel mourned deeply in every community,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.26">rulers and elders groaned, maidens and young men became faint, the beauty of women faded.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.27">Every bridegroom took up the lament; she who sat in the bridal chamber was mourning.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.28">Even the land shook for its inhabitants, and all the house of Jacob was clothed with shame.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.29">Two years later the king sent to the cities of Judah a chief collector of tribute, and he came to Jerusalem with a large force.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.30">Deceitfully he spoke peaceable words to them, and they believed him; but he suddenly fell upon the city, dealt it a severe blow, and destroyed many people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.31">He plundered the city, burned it with fire, and tore down its houses and its surrounding walls.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.32">And they took captive the women and children, and seized the cattle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.33">Then they fortified the city of David with a great strong wall and strong towers, and it became their citadel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.34">And they stationed there a sinful people, lawless men. These strengthened their position;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.35">they stored up arms and food, and collecting the spoils of Jerusalem they stored them there, and became a great snare.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.36">It became an ambush against the sanctuary, an evil adversary of Israel continually.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.37">On every side of the sanctuary they shed innocent blood; they even defiled the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.38">Because of them the residents of Jerusalem fled; she became a dwelling of strangers; she became strange to her offspring, and her children forsook her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.39">Her sanctuary became desolate as a desert; her feasts were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into a reproach, her honor into contempt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.40">Her dishonor now grew as great as her glory; her exaltation was turned into mourning.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.41">Then the king wrote to his whole kingdom that all should be one people,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.42">and that each should give up his customs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.43">All the Gentiles accepted the command of the king. Many even from Israel gladly adopted his religion; they sacrificed to idols and profaned the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.44">And the king sent letters by messengers to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah; he directed them to follow customs strange to the land,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.45">to forbid burnt offerings and sacrifices and drink offerings in the sanctuary, to profane sabbaths and feasts,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.46">to defile the sanctuary and the priests,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.47">to build altars and sacred precincts and shrines for idols, to sacrifice swine and unclean animals,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.48">and to leave their sons uncircumcised. They were to make themselves abominable by everything unclean and profane,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.49">so that they should forget the law and change all the ordinances.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.50">"And whoever does not obey the command of the king shall die."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.51">In such words he wrote to his whole kingdom. And he appointed inspectors over all the people and commanded the cities of Judah to offer sacrifice, city by city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.52">Many of the people, every one who forsook the law, joined them, and they did evil in the land;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.53">they drove Israel into hiding in every place of refuge they had.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.54">Now on the fifteenth day of Chislev, in the one hundred and forty-fifth year, they erected a desolating sacrilege upon the altar of burnt offering. They also built altars in the surrounding cities of Judah,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.55">and burned incense at the doors of the houses and in the streets.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.56">The books of the law which they found they tore to pieces and burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.57">Where the book of the covenant was found in the possession of any one, or if any one adhered to the law, the decree of the king condemned him to death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.58">They kept using violence against Israel, against those found month after month in the cities.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.59">And on the twenty-fifth day of the month they offered sacrifice on the altar which was upon the altar of burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.60">According to the decree, they put to death the women who had their children circumcised,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.61">and their families and those who circumcised them; and they hung the infants from their mothers' necks.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.62">But many in Israel stood firm and were resolved in their hearts not to eat unclean food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.63">They chose to die rather than to be defiled by food or to profane the holy covenant; and they did die.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.1.64">And very great wrath came upon Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Esd.2" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.1">In those days Mattathias the son of John, son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, moved from Jerusalem and settled in Modein.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.2">He had five sons, John surnamed Gaddi,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.3">Simon called Thassi,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.4">Judas called Maccabeus,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.5">Eleazar called Avaran, and Jonathan called Apphus.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.6">He saw the blasphemies being committed in Judah and Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.7">and said, "Alas! Why was I born to see this, the ruin of my people, the ruin of the holy city, and to dwell there when it was given over to the enemy, the sanctuary given over to aliens?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.8">Her temple has become like a man without honor;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.9">her glorious vessels have been carried into captivity. Her babes have been killed in her streets, her youths by the sword of the foe.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.10">What nation has not inherited her palaces and has not seized her spoils?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.11">All her adornment has been taken away; no longer free, she has become a slave.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.12">And behold, our holy place, our beauty, and our glory have been laid waste; the Gentiles have profaned it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.13">Why should we live any longer?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.14">And Mattathias and his sons rent their clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned greatly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.15">Then the king's officers who were enforcing the apostasy came to the city of Modein to make them offer sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.16">Many from Israel came to them; and Mattathias and his sons were assembled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.17">Then the king's officers spoke to Mattathias as follows: "You are a leader, honored and great in this city, and supported by sons and brothers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.18">Now be the first to come and do what the king commands, as all the Gentiles and the men of Judah and those that are left in Jerusalem have done. Then you and your sons will be numbered among the friends of the king, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.19">But Mattathias answered and said in a loud voice: "Even if all the nations that live under the rule of the king obey him, and have chosen to do his commandments, departing each one from the religion of his fathers,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.20">yet I and my sons and my brothers will live by the covenant of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.21">Far be it from us to desert the law and the ordinances.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.22">We will not obey the king's words by turning aside from our religion to the right hand or to the left."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.23">When he had finished speaking these words, a Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice upon the altar in Modein, according to the king's command.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.24">When Mattathias saw it, be burned with zeal and his heart was stirred. He gave vent to righteous anger; he ran and killed him upon the altar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.25">At the same time he killed the king's officer who was forcing them to sacrifice, and he tore down the altar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.26">Thus he burned with zeal for the law, as Phinehas did against Zimri the son of Salu.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.27">Then Mattathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying: "Let every one who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.28">And he and his sons fled to the hills and left all that they had in the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.29">Then many who were seeking righteousness and justice went down to the wilderness to dwell there,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.30">they, their sons, their wives, and their cattle, because evils pressed heavily upon them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.31">And it was reported to the king's officers, and to the troops in Jerusalem the city of David, that men who had rejected the king's command had gone down to the hiding places in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.32">Many pursued them, and overtook them; they encamped opposite them and prepared for battle against them on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.33">And they said to them, "Enough of this! Come out and do what the king commands, and you will live."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.34">But they said, "We will not come out, nor will we do what the king commands and so profane the sabbath day."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.35">Then the enemy hastened to attack them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.36">But they did not answer them or hurl a stone at them or block up their hiding places,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.37">for they said, "Let us all die in our innocence; heaven and earth testify for us that you are killing us unjustly."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.38">So they attacked them on the sabbath, and they died, with their wives and children and cattle, to the number of a thousand persons.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.39">When Mattathias and his friends learned of it, they mourned for them deeply.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.40">And each said to his neighbor: "If we all do as our brethren have done and refuse to fight with the Gentiles for our lives and for our ordinances, they will quickly destroy us from the earth."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.41">So they made this decision that day: "Let us fight against every man who comes to attack us on the sabbath day; let us not all die as our brethren died in their hiding places."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.42">Then there united with them a company of Hasideans, mighty warriors of Israel, every one who offered himself willingly for the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.43">And all who became fugitives to escape their troubles joined them and reinforced them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.44">They organized an army, and struck down sinners in their anger and lawless men in their wrath; the survivors fled to the Gentiles for safety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.45">And Mattathias and his friends went about and tore down the altars;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.46">they forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys that they found within the borders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.47">They hunted down the arrogant men, and the work prospered in their hands.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.48">They rescued the law out of the hands of the Gentiles and kings, and they never let the sinner gain the upper hand.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.49">Now the days drew near for Mattathias to die, and he said to his sons: "Arrogance and reproach have now become strong; it is a time of ruin and furious anger.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.50">Now, my children, show zeal for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.51">"Remember the deeds of the fathers, which they did in their generations; and receive great honor and an everlasting name.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.52">Was not Abraham found faithful when tested, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.53">Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment, and became lord of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.54">Phinehas our father, because he was deeply zealous, received the covenant of everlasting priesthood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.55">Joshua, because he fulfilled the command, became a judge in Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.56">Caleb, because he testified in the assembly, received an inheritance in the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.57">David, because he was merciful, inherited the throne of the kingdom for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.58">Elijah because of great zeal for the law was taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.59">Hannaniah, Azariah, and Mishael believed and were saved from the flame.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.60">Daniel because of his innocence was delivered from the mouth of the lions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.61">"And so observe, from generation to generation, that none who put their trust in him will lack strength.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.62">Do not fear the words of a sinner, for his splendor will turn into dung and worms.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.63">Today he will be exalted, but tomorrow he will not be found, because he has returned to the dust, and his plans will perish.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.64">My children, be courageous and grow strong in the law, for by it you will gain honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.65">"Now behold, I know that Simeon your brother is wise in counsel; always listen to him; he shall be your father.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.66">Judas Maccabeus has been a mighty warrior from his youth; he shall command the army for you and fight the battle against the peoples.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.67">You shall rally about you all who observe the law, and avenge the wrong done to your people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.68">Pay back the Gentiles in full, and heed what the law commands."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.69">Then he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.2.70">He died in the one hundred and forty-sixth year and was buried in the tomb of his fathers at Modein. And all Israel mourned for him with great lamentation.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Esd.3" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.1">Then Judas his son, who was called Maccabeus, took command in his place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.2">All his brothers and all who had joined his father helped him; they gladly fought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.3">He extended the glory of his people. Like a giant he put on his breastplate; he girded on his armor of war and waged battles, protecting the host by his sword.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.4">He was like a lion in his deeds, like a lion's cub roaring for prey.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.5">He searched out and pursued the lawless; he burned those who troubled his people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.6">Lawless men shrank back for fear of him; all the evildoers were confounded; and deliverance prospered by his hand.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.7">He embittered many kings, but he made Jacob glad by his deeds, and his memory is blessed for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.8">He went through the cities of Judah; he destroyed the ungodly out of the land; thus he turned away wrath from Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.9">He was renowned to the ends of the earth; he gathered in those who were perishing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.10">But Apollonius gathered together Gentiles and a large force from Samaria to fight against Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.11">When Judas learned of it, he went out to meet him, and he defeated and killed him. Many were wounded and fell, and the rest fled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.12">Then they seized their spoils; and Judas took the sword of Apollonius, and used it in battle the rest of his life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.13">Now when Seron, the commander of the Syrian army, heard that Judas had gathered a large company, including a body of faithful men who stayed with him and went out to battle,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.14">he said, "I will make a name for myself and win honor in the kingdom. I will make war on Judas and his companions, who scorn the king's command."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.15">And again a strong army of ungodly men went up with him to help him, to take vengeance on the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.16">When he approached the ascent of Beth-horon, Judas went out to meet him with a small company.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.17">But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to Judas, "How can we, few as we are, fight against so great and strong a multitude? And we are faint, for we have eaten nothing today."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.18">Judas replied, "It is easy for many to be hemmed in by few, for in the sight of Heaven there is no difference between saving by many or by few.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.19">It is not on the size of the army that victory in battle depends, but strength comes from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.20">They come against us in great pride and lawlessness to destroy us and our wives and our children, and to despoil us;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.21">but we fight for our lives and our laws.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.22">He himself will crush them before us; as for you, do not be afraid of them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.23">When he finished speaking, he rushed suddenly against Seron and his army, and they were crushed before him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.24">They pursued them down the descent of Beth-horon to the plain; eight hundred of them fell, and the rest fled into the land of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.25">Then Judas and his brothers began to be feared, and terror fell upon the Gentiles round about them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.26">His fame reached the king, and the Gentiles talked of the battles of Judas.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.27">When king Antiochus heard these reports, he was greatly angered; and he sent and gathered all the forces of his kingdom, a very strong army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.28">And he opened his coffers and gave a year's pay to his forces, and ordered them to be ready for any need.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.29">Then he saw that the money in the treasury was exhausted, and that the revenues from the country were small because of the dissension and disaster which he had caused in the land by abolishing the laws that had existed from the earliest days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.30">He feared that he might not have such funds as he had before for his expenses and for the gifts which he used to give more lavishly than preceding kings.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.31">He was greatly perplexed in mind, and determined to go to Persia and collect the revenues from those regions and raise a large fund.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.32">He left Lysias, a distinguished man of royal lineage, in charge of the king's affairs from the river Euphrates to the borders of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.33">Lysias was also to take care of Antiochus his son until he returned.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.34">And he turned over to Lysias half of his troops and the elephants, and gave him orders about all that he wanted done. As for the residents of Judea and Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.35">Lysias was to send a force against them to wipe out and destroy the strength of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem; he was to banish the memory of them from the place,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.36">settle aliens in all their territory, and distribute their land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.37">Then the king took the remaining half of his troops and departed from Antioch his capital in the one hundred and forty-seventh year. He crossed the Euphrates river and went through the upper provinces.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.38">Lysias chose Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor and Gorgias, mighty men among the friends of the king,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.39">and sent with them forty thousand infantry and seven thousand cavalry to go into the land of Judah and destroy it, as the king had commanded.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.40">so they departed with their entire force, and when they arrived they encamped near Emmaus in the plain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.41">When the traders of the region heard what was said to them, they took silver and gold in immense amounts, and fetters, and went to the camp to get the sons of Israel for slaves. And forces from Syria and the land of the Philistines joined with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.42">Now Judas and his brothers saw that misfortunes had increased and that the forces were encamped in their territory. They also learned what the king had commanded to do to the people to cause their final destruction.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.43">But they said to one another, "Let us repair the destruction of our people, and fight for our people and the sanctuary."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.44">And the congregation assembled to be ready for battle, and to pray and ask for mercy and compassion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.45">Jerusalem was uninhabited like a wilderness; not one of her children went in or out.The sanctuary was trampled own, and the sons of aliens held the citadel; it was a lodging place for the Gentiles. Joy was taken from Jacob; the flute and the harp ceased to play.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.46">So they assembled and went to Mizpah, opposite Jerusalem, because Israel formerly had a place of prayer in Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.47">They fasted that day, put on sackcloth and sprinkled ashes on their heads, and rent their clothes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.48">And they opened the book of the law to inquire into those matters about which the Gentiles were consulting the images of their idols.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.49">They also brought the garments of the priesthood and the first fruits and the tithes, and they stirred up the Nazirites who had completed their days;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.50">and they cried aloud to Heaven, saying, "What shall we do with these? Where shall we take them?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.51">Thy sanctuary is trampled down and profaned, and thy priests mourn in humiliation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.52">And behold, the Gentiles are assembled against us to destroy us; thou knowest what they plot against us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.53">How will we be able to withstand them, if thou dost not help us?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.54">Then they sounded the trumpets and gave a loud shout.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.55">After this Judas appointed leaders of the people, in charge of thousands and hundreds and fifties and tens.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.56">And he said to those who were building houses, or were betrothed, or were planting vineyards, or were fainthearted, that each should return to his home, according to the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.57">Then the army marched out and encamped to the south of Emmaus.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.58">And Judas said, "Gird yourselves and be valiant. Be ready early in the morning to fight with these Gentiles who have assembled against us to destroy us and our sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.59">It is better for us to die in battle than to see the misfortunes of our nation and of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.3.60">But as his will in heaven may be, so he will do."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Esd.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.1">Now Gorgias took five thousand infantry and a thousand picked cavalry, and this division moved out by night</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.2">to fall upon the camp of the Jews and attack them suddenly. Men from the citadel were his guides.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.3">But Judas heard of it, and he and his mighty men moved out to attack the king's force in Emmaus</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.4">while the division was still absent from the camp.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.5">When Gorgias entered the camp of Judas by night, he found no one there, so he looked for them in the hills, because he said, "These men are fleeing from us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.6">At daybreak Judas appeared in the plain with three thousand men, but they did not have armor and swords such as they desired.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.[7]">And they saw the camp of the Gentiles, strong and fortified, with cavalry round about it; and these men were trained in war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.8">But Judas said to the men who were with him, "Do not fear their numbers or be afraid when they charge.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.9">Remember how our fathers were saved at the Red Sea, when Pharaoh with his forces pursued them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.10">And now let us cry to Heaven, to see whether he will favor us and remember his covenant with our fathers and crush this army before us today.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.11">Then all the Gentiles will know that there is one who redeems and saves Israel."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.12">When the foreigners looked up and saw them coming against them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.13">they went forth from their camp to battle. Then the men with Judas blew their trumpets</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.14">and engaged in battle. The Gentiles were crushed and fled into the plain,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.15">and all those in the rear fell by the sword. They pursued them to Gazara, and to the plains of Idumea, and to Azotus and Jamnia; and three thousand of them fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.16">Then Judas and his force turned back from pursuing them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.17">and he said to the people, "Do not be greedy for plunder, for there is a battle before us;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.19">Just as Judas was finishing this speech, a detachment appeared, coming out of the hills.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.20">They saw that their army had been put to flight, and that the Jews were burning the camp, for the smoke that was seen showed what had happened.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.21">When they perceived this they were greatly frightened, and when they also saw the army of Judas drawn up in the plain for battle,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.22">they all fled into the land of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.23">Then Judas returned to plunder the camp, and they seized much gold and silver, and cloth dyed blue and sea purple, and great riches.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.24">On their return they sang hymns and praises to Heaven, for he is good, for his mercy endures for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.25">Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.26">Those of the foreigners who escaped went and reported to Lysias all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.27">When he heard it, he was perplexed and discouraged, for things had not happened to Israel as he had intended, nor had they turned out as the king had commanded him.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.30">When he saw that the army was strong, he prayed, saying, "Blessed art thou, O Savior of Israel, who didst crush the attack of the mighty warrior by the hand of thy servant David, and didst give the camp of the Philistines into the hands of Jonathan, the son of Saul, and of the man who carried his armor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.31">So do thou hem in this army by the hand of thy people Israel, and let them be ashamed of their troops and their cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.32">Fill them with cowardice; melt the boldness of their strength; let them tremble in their destruction.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.33">Strike them down with the sword of those who love thee, and let all who know thy name praise thee with hymns."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.34">Then both sides attacked, and there fell of the army of Lysias five thousand men; they fell in action.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.35">And when Lysias saw the rout of his troops and observed the boldness which inspired those of Judas, and how ready they were either to live or to die nobly, he departed to Antioch and enlisted mercenaries, to invade Judea again with an even larger army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.36">Then said Judas and his brothers, "Behold, our enemies are crushed; let us go up to cleanse the sanctuary and dedicate it."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.37">So all the army assembled and they went up to Mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.38">And they saw the sanctuary desolate, the altar profaned, and the gates burned. In the courts they saw bushes sprung up as in a thicket, or as on one of the mountains. They saw also the chambers of the priests in ruins.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.39">Then they rent their clothes, and mourned with great lamentation, and sprinkled themselves with ashes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.40">They fell face down on the ground, and sounded the signal on the trumpets, and cried out to Heaven.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.41">Then Judas detailed men to fight against those in the citadel until he had cleansed the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.42">He chose blameless priests devoted to the law,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.43">and they cleansed the sanctuary and removed the defiled stones to an unclean place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.44">They deliberated what to do about the altar of burnt offering, which had been profaned.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.45">And they thought it best to tear it down, lest it bring reproach upon them, for the Gentiles had defiled it. So they tore down the altar,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.46">and stored the stones in a convenient place on the temple hill until there should come a prophet to tell what to do with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.47">Then they took unhewn stones, as the law directs, and built a new altar like the former one.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.48">They also rebuilt the sanctuary and the interior of the temple, and consecrated the courts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.49">They made new holy vessels, and brought the lampstand, the altar of incense, and the table into the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.50">Then they burned incense on the altar and lighted the lamps on the lampstand, and these gave light in the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.51">They placed the bread on the table and hung up the curtains. Thus they finished all the work they had undertaken.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.52">Early in the morning on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, which is the month of Chislev, in the one hundred and forty-eighth year,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.53">they rose and offered sacrifice, as the law directs, on the new altar of burnt offering which they had built.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.54">At the very season and on the very day that the Gentiles had profaned it, it was dedicated with songs and harps and lutes and cymbals.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.55">All the people fell on their faces and worshiped and blessed Heaven, who had prospered them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.56">So they celebrated the dedication of the altar for eight days, and offered burnt offerings with gladness; they offered a sacrifice of deliverance and praise.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.57">They decorated the front of the temple with golden crowns and small shields; they restored the gates and the chambers for the priests, and furnished them with doors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.58">There was very great gladness among the people, and the reproach of the Gentiles was removed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.59">Then Judas and his brothers and all the assembly of Israel determined that every year at that season the days of dedication of the altar should be observed with gladness and joy for eight days, beginning with the twenty-fifth day of the month of Chislev.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.60">At that time they fortified Mount Zion with high walls and strong towers round about, to keep the Gentiles from coming and trampling them down as they had done before.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.4.61">And he stationed a garrison there to hold it. He also fortified Beth-zur, so that the people might have a stronghold that faced Idumea.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Esd.5" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.1">When the Gentiles round about heard that the altar had been built and the sanctuary dedicated as it was before, they became very angry,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.2">and they determined to destroy the descendants of Jacob who lived among them. So they began to kill and destroy among the people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.3">But Judas made war on the sons of Esau in Idumea, at Akrabattene, because they kept lying in wait for Israel. He dealt them a heavy blow and humbled them and despoiled them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.4">He also remembered the wickedness of the sons of Baean, who were a trap and a snare to the people and ambushed them on the highways.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.5">They were shut up by him in their towers; and he encamped against them, vowed their complete destruction, and burned with fire their towers and all who were in them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.6">Then he crossed over to attack the Ammonites, where he found a strong band and many people with Timothy as their leader.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.9">Now the Gentiles in Gilead gathered together against the Israelites who lived in their territory, and planned to destroy them. But they fled to the stronghold of Dathema,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.10">and sent to Judas and his brothers a letter which said, "The Gentiles around us have gathered together against us to destroy us.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.12">Now then come and rescue us from their hands, for many of us have fallen,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.13">and all our brethren who were in the land of Tob have been killed; the enemy have captured their wives and children and goods, and have destroyed about a thousand men there."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.14">While the letter was still being read, behold, other messengers, with their garments rent, came from Galilee and made a similar report;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.15">they said that against them had gathered together men of Ptolemais and Tyre and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, "to annihilate us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.16">When Judas and the people heard these messages, a great assembly was called to determine what they should do for their brethren who were in distress and were being attacked by enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.17">Then Judas said to Simon his brother, "Choose your men and go and rescue your brethren in Galilee; I and Jonathan my brother will go to Gilead."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.18">But he left Joseph, the son of Zechariah, and Azariah, a leader of the people, with the rest of the forces, in Judea to guard it;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.19">and he gave them this command, "Take charge of this people, but do not engage in battle with the Gentiles until we return."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.20">Then three thousand men were assigned to Simon to go to Galilee, and eight thousand to Judas for Gilead.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.21">so Simon went to Galilee and fought many battles against the Gentiles, and the Gentiles were crushed before him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.22">He pursued them to the gate of Ptolemais, and as many as three thousand of the Gentiles fell, and he despoiled them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.23">Then he took the Jews of Galilee and Arbatta, with their wives and children, and all they possessed, and led them to Judea with great rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.24">Judas Maccabeus and Jonathan his brother crossed the Jordan and went three days' journey into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.25">They encountered the Nabateans, who met them peaceably and told them all that had happened to their brethren in Gilead:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.26">"Many of them have been shut up in Bozrah and Bosor, in Alema and Chaspho, Maked and Carnaim" -- all these cities were strong and large--</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.27">"and some have been shut up in the other cities of Gilead; the enemy are getting ready to attack the strongholds tomorrow and take and destroy all these men in one day."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.28">Then Judas and his army quickly turned back by the wilderness road to Bozrah; and he took the city, and killed every male by the edge of the sword; then he seized all its spoils and burned it with fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.29">He departed from there at night, and they went all the way to the stronghold of Dathema.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.30">At dawn they looked up, and behold, a large company, that could not be counted, carrying ladders and engines of war to capture the stronghold, and attacking the Jews within.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.31">So Judas saw that the battle had begun and that the cry of the city went up to Heaven with trumpets and loud shouts,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.32">and he said to the men of his forces, "Fight today for your brethren!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.33">Then he came up behind them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets and cried aloud in prayer.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.34">And when the army of Timothy realized that it was Maccabeus, they fled before him, and he dealt them a heavy blow. As many as eight thousand of them fell that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.35">Next he turned aside to Alema, and fought against it and took it; and he killed every male in it, plundered it, and burned it with fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.36">From there he marched on and took Chaspho, Maked, and Bosor, and the other cities of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.37">After these things Timothy gathered another army and encamped opposite Raphon, on the other side of the stream.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.38">Judas sent men to spy out the camp, and they reported to him, "All the Gentiles around us have gathered to him; it is a very large force.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.39">They also have hired Arabs to help them, and they are encamped across the stream, ready to come and fight against you." And Judas went to meet them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.40">Now as Judas and his army drew near to the stream of water, Timothy said to the officers of his forces, "If he crosses over to us first, we will not be able to resist him, for he will surely defeat us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.41">But if he shows fear and camps on the other side of the river, we will cross over to him and defeat him."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.42">When Judas approached the stream of water, he stationed the scribes of the people at the stream and gave them this command, "Permit no man to encamp, but make them all enter the battle."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.43">Then he crossed over against them first, and the whole army followed him. All the Gentiles were defeated before him, and they threw away their arms and fled into the sacred precincts at Carnaim.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.44">But he took the city and burned the sacred precincts with fire, together with all who were in them. Thus Carnaim was conquered; they could stand before Judas no longer.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.45">Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites in Gilead, the small and the great, with their wives and children and goods, a very large company, to go to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.46">So they came to Ephron. This was a large and very strong city on the road, and they could not go round it to the right or to the left; they had to go through it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.47">But the men of the city shut them out and blocked up the gates with stones.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.48">And Judas sent them this friendly message, "Let us pass through your land to get to our land. No one will do you harm; we will simply pass by on foot." But they refused to open to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.49">Then Judas ordered proclamation to be made to the army that each should encamp where he was.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.50">So the men of the forces encamped, and he fought against the city all that day and all the night, and the city was delivered into his hands.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.51">He destroyed every male by the edge of the sword, and razed and plundered the city. Then he passed through the city over the slain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.52">And they crossed the Jordan into the large plain before Beth-shan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.53">And Judas kept rallying the laggards and encouraging the people all the way till he came to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.54">So they went up to Mount Zion with gladness and joy, and offered burnt offerings, because not one of them had fallen before they returned in safety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.55">Now while Judas and Jonathan were in Gilead and Simon his brother was in Galilee before Ptolemais,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.56">Joseph, the son of Zechariah, and Azariah, the commanders of the forces, heard of their brave deeds and of the heroic war they had fought.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.57">So they said, "Let us also make a name for ourselves; let us go and make war on the Gentiles around us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.58">And they issued orders to the men of the forces that were with them, and they marched against Jamnia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.59">And Gorgias and his men came out of the city to meet them in battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.60">Then Joseph and Azariah were routed, and were pursued to the borders of Judea; as many as two thousand of the people of Israel fell that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.61">Thus the people suffered a great rout because, thinking to do a brave deed, they did not listen to Judas and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.62">But they did not belong to the family of those men through whom deliverance was given to Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.63">The man Judas and his brothers were greatly honored in all Israel and among all the Gentiles, wherever their name was heard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.64">Men gathered to them and praised them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.65">Then Judas and his brothers went forth and fought the sons of Esau in the land to the south. He struck Hebron and its villages and tore down its strongholds and burned its towers round about.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.66">Then he marched off to go into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Marisa.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.67">On that day some priests, who wished to do a brave deed, fell in battle, for they went out to battle unwisely.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.5.68">But Judas turned aside to Azotus in the land of the Philistines; he tore down their altars, and the graven images of their gods he burned with fire; he plundered the cities and returned to the land of Judah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Esd.6" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.1">King Antiochus was going through the upper provinces when he heard that Elymais in Persia was a city famed for its wealth in silver and gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.2">Its temple was very rich, containing golden shields, breastplates, and weapons left there by Alexander, the son of Philip, the Macedonian king who first reigned over the Greeks.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.3">So he came and tried to take the city and plunder it, but he could not, because his plan became known to the men of the city</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.4">and they withstood him in battle. So he fled and in great grief departed from there to return to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.5">Then some one came to him in Persia and reported that the armies which had gone into the land of Judah had been routed;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.6">that Lysias had gone first with a strong force, but had turned and fled before the Jews; that the Jews had grown strong from the arms, supplies, and abundant spoils which they had taken from the armies they had cut down;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.7">that they had torn down the abomination which he had erected upon the altar in Jerusalem; and that they had surrounded the sanctuary with high walls as before, and also Beth-zur, his city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.8">When the king heard this news, he was astounded and badly shaken. He took to his bed and became sick from grief, because things had not turned out for him as he had planned.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.9">He lay there for many days, because deep grief continually gripped him, and he concluded that he was dying.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.10">So he called all his friends and said to them, "Sleep departs from my eyes and I am downhearted with worry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.11">I said to myself, `To what distress I have come! And into what a great flood I now am plunged! For I was kind and beloved in my power.'</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.13">I know that it is because of this that these evils have come upon me; and behold, I am perishing of deep grief in a strange land."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.14">Then he called for Philip, one of his friends, and made him ruler over all his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.15">He gave him the crown and his robe and the signet, that he might guide Antiochus his son and bring him up to be king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.16">Thus Antiochus the king died there in the one hundred and forty-ninth year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.17">And when Lysias learned that the king was dead, he set up Antiochus the king's son to reign. Lysias had brought him up as a boy, and he named him Eupator.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.18">Now the men in the citadel kept hemming Israel in around the sanctuary. They were trying in every way to harm them and strengthen the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.19">So Judas decided to destroy them, and assembled all the people to besiege them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.20">They gathered together and besieged the citadel in the one hundred and fiftieth year; and he built siege towers and other engines of war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.21">But some of the garrison escaped from the siege and some of the ungodly Israelites joined them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.22">They went to the king and said, "How long will you fail to do justice and to avenge our brethren?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.23">We were happy to serve your father, to live by what he said and to follow his commands.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.24">For this reason the sons of our people besieged the citadel and became hostile to us; moreover, they have put to death as many of us as they have caught, and they have seized our inheritances.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.25">And not against us alone have they stretched out their hands, but also against all the lands on their borders.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.26">And behold, today they have encamped against the citadel in Jerusalem to take it; they have fortified both the sanctuary and Beth-zur;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.27">and unless you quickly prevent them, they will do still greater things, and you will not be able to stop them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.28">The king was enraged when he heard this. He assembled all his friends, the commanders of his forces and those in authority.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.29">And mercenary forces came to him from other kingdoms and from islands of the seas.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.30">The number of his forces was a hundred thousand foot soldiers, twenty thousand horsemen, and thirty-two elephants accustomed to war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.31">They came through Idumea and encamped against Beth-zur, and for many days they fought and built engines of war; but the Jews sallied out and burned these with fire, and fought manfully.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.32">Then Judas marched away from the citadel and encamped at Beth-zechariah, opposite the camp of the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.33">Early in the morning the king rose and took his army by a forced march along the road to Beth-zechariah, and his troops made ready for battle and sounded their trumpets.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.34">They showed the elephants the juice of grapes and mulberries, to arouse them for battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.35">And they distributed the beasts among the phalanxes; with each elephant they stationed a thousand men armed with coats of mail, and with brass helmets on their heads; and five hundred picked horsemen were assigned to each beast.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.36">These took their position beforehand wherever the beast was; wherever it went they went with it, and they never left it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.37">And upon the elephants were wooden towers, strong and covered; they were fastened upon each beast by special harness, and upon each were four armed men who fought from there, and also its Indian driver.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.38">The rest of the horsemen were stationed on either side, on the two flanks of the army, to harass the enemy while being themselves protected by the phalanxes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.39">When the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the hills were ablaze with them and gleamed like flaming torches.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.40">Now a part of the king's army was spread out on the high hills, and some troops were on the plain, and they advanced steadily and in good order.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.41">All who heard the noise made by their multitude, by the marching of the multitude and the clanking of their arms, trembled, for the army was very large and strong.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.42">But Judas and his army advanced to the battle, and six hundred men of the king's army fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.43">And Eleazar, called Avaran, saw that one of the beasts was equipped with royal armor. It was taller than all the others, and he supposed that the king was upon it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.44">So he gave his life to save his people and to win for himself an everlasting name.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.45">He courageously ran into the midst of the phalanx to reach it; he killed men right and left, and they parted before him on both sides.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.46">He got under the elephant, stabbed it from beneath, and killed it; but it fell to the ground upon him and he died.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.47">And when the Jews saw the royal might and the fierce attack of the forces, they turned away in flight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.48">The soldiers of the king's army went up to Jerusalem against them, and the king encamped in Judea and at Mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.49">He made peace with the men of Beth-zur, and they evacuated the city, because they had no provisions there to withstand a siege, since it was a sabbatical year for the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.50">So the king took Beth-zur and stationed a guard there to hold it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.51">Then he encamped before the sanctuary for many days. He set up siege towers, engines of war to throw fire and stones, machines to shoot arrows, and catapults.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.52">The Jews also made engines of war to match theirs, and fought for many days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.53">But they had no food in storage, because it was the seventh year; those who found safety in Judea from the Gentiles had consumed the last of the stores.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.54">Few men were left in the sanctuary, because famine had prevailed over the rest and they had been scattered, each to his own place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.55">Then Lysias heard that Philip, whom King Antiochus while still living had appointed to bring up Antiochus his son to be king,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.56">had returned from Persia and Media with the forces that had gone with the king, and that he was trying to seize control of the government.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.57">So he quickly gave orders to depart, and said to the king, to the commanders of the forces, and to the men, "We daily grow weaker, our food supply is scant, the place against which we are fighting is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom press urgently upon us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.58">Now then let us come to terms with these men, and make peace with them and with all their nation,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.59">and agree to let them live by their laws as they did before; for it was on account of their laws which we abolished that they became angry and did all these things."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.60">The speech pleased the king and the commanders, and he sent to the Jews an offer of peace, and they accepted it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.61">So the king and the commanders gave them their oath. On these conditions the Jews evacuated the stronghold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.62">But when the king entered Mount Zion and saw what a strong fortress the place was, he broke the oath he had sworn and gave orders to tear down the wall all around.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.6.63">Then he departed with haste and returned to Antioch. He found Philip in control of the city, but he fought against him, and took the city by force.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Esd.7" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.1">In the one hundred and fifty-first year Demetrius the son of Seleucus set forth from Rome, sailed with a few men to a city by the sea, and there began to reign.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.2">As he was entering the royal palace of his fathers, the army seized Antiochus and Lysias to bring them to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.3">But when this act became known to him, he said, "Do not let me see their faces!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.4">So the army killed them, and Demetrius took his seat upon the throne of his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.5">Then there came to him all the lawless and ungodly men of Israel; they were led by Alcimus, who wanted to be high priest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.6">And they brought to the king this accusation against the people: "Judas and his brothers have destroyed all your friends, and have driven us out of our land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.7">Now then send a man whom you trust; let him go and see all the ruin which Judas has brought upon us and upon the land of the king, and let him punish them and all who help them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.8">So the king chose Bacchides, one of the king's friends, governor of the province Beyond the River; he was a great man in the kingdom and was faithful to the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.9">And he sent him, and with him the ungodly Alcimus, whom he made high priest; and he commanded him to take vengeance on the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.10">So they marched away and came with a large force into the land of Judah; and he sent messengers to Judas and his brothers with peaceable but treacherous words.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.11">But they paid no attention to their words, for they saw that they had come with a large force.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.12">Then a group of scribes appeared in a body before Alcimus and Bacchides to ask for just terms.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.13">The Hasideans were first among the sons of Israel to seek peace from them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.14">for they said, "A priest of the line of Aaron has come with the army, and he will not harm us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.15">And he spoke peaceable words to them and swore this oath to them, "We will not seek to injure you or your friends."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.16">So they trusted him; but he seized sixty of them and killed them in one day, in accordance with the word which was written,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.17">"The flesh of thy saints and their blood they poured out round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.18">Then the fear and dread of them fell upon all the people, for they said, "There is no truth or justice in them, for they have violated the agreement and the oath which they swore."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.19">Then Bacchides departed from Jerusalem and encamped in Beth-zaith. And he sent and seized many of the men who had deserted to him, and some of the people, and killed them and threw them into a great pit.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.20">He placed Alcimus in charge of the country and left with him a force to help him; then Bacchides went back to the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.21">Alcimus strove for the high priesthood,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.22">and all who were troubling their people joined him. They gained control of the land of Judah and did great damage in Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.23">And Judas saw all the evil that Alcimus and those with him had done among the sons of Israel; it was more than the Gentiles had done.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.24">So Judas went out into all the surrounding parts of Judea, and took vengeance on the men who had deserted, and he prevented those in the city from going out into the country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.25">When Alcimus saw that Judas and those with him had grown strong, and realized that he could not withstand them, he returned to the king and brought wicked charges against them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.26">Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honored princes, who hated and detested Israel, and he commanded him to destroy the people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.27">So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a large force, and treacherously sent to Judas and his brothers this peaceable message,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.28">"Let there be no fighting between me and you; I shall come with a few men to see you face to face in peace."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.29">So he came to Judas, and they greeted one another peaceably. But the enemy were ready to seize Judas.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.30">It became known to Judas that Nicanor had come to him with treacherous intent, and he was afraid of him and would not meet him again.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.31">When Nicanor learned that his plan had been disclosed, he went out to meet Judas in battle near Caphar-salama.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.32">About five hundred men of the army of Nicanor fell, and the rest fled into the city of David.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.33">After these events Nicanor went up to Mount Zion. Some of the priests came out of the sanctuary, and some of the elders of the people, to greet him peaceably and to show him the burnt offering that was being offered for the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.34">But he mocked them and derided them and defiled them and spoke arrogantly,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.35">and in anger he swore this oath, "Unless Judas and his army are delivered into my hands this time, then if I return safely I will burn up this house." And he went out in great anger.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.36">Then the priests went in and stood before the altar and the temple, and they wept and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.37">"Thou didst choose this house to be called by thy name, and to be for thy people a house of prayer and supplication.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.38">Take vengeance on this man and on his army, and let them fall by the sword; remember their blasphemies, and let them live no longer."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.39">Now Nicanor went out from Jerusalem and encamped in Beth-horon, and the Syrian army joined him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.40">And Judas encamped in Adasa with three thousand men. Then Judas prayed and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.41">"When the messengers from the king spoke blasphemy, thy angel went forth and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand of the Assyrians.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.42">So also crush this army before us today; let the rest learn that Nicanor has spoken wickedly against the sanctuary, and judge him according to this wickedness."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.43">So the armies met in battle on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. The army of Nicanor was crushed, and he himself was the first to fall in the battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.44">When his army saw that Nicanor had fallen, they threw down their arms and fled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.45">The Jews pursued them a day's journey, from Adasa as far as Gazara, and as they followed kept sounding the battle call on the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.46">And men came out of all the villages of Judea round about, and they out-flanked the enemy and drove them back to their pursuers, so that they all fell by the sword; not even one of them was left.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.47">Then the Jews seized the spoils and the plunder, and they cut off Nicanor's head and the right hand which he so arrogantly stretched out, and brought them and displayed them just outside Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.48">The people rejoiced greatly and celebrated that day as a day of great gladness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.49">And they decreed that this day should be celebrated each year on the thirteenth day of Adar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.7.50">So the land of Judah had rest for a few days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Esd.8" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.1">Now Judas heard of the fame of the Romans, that they were very strong and were well-disposed toward all who made an alliance with them, that they pledged friendship to those who came to them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.2">and that they were very strong. Men told him of their wars and of the brave deeds which they were doing among the Gauls, how they had defeated them and forced them to pay tribute,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.3">and what they had done in the land of Spain to get control of the silver and gold mines there,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.4">and how they had gained control of the whole region by their planning and patience, even though the place was far distant from them. They also subdued the kings who came against them from the ends of the earth, until they crushed them and inflicted great disaster upon them; the rest paid them tribute every year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.5">Philip, and Perseus king of the Macedonians, and the others who rose up against them, they crushed in battle and conquered.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.6">They also defeated Antiochus the Great, king of Asia, who went to fight against them with a hundred and twenty elephants and with cavalry and chariots and a very large army. He was crushed by them;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.7">they took him alive and decreed that he and those who should reign after him should pay a heavy tribute and give hostages and surrender some of their best provinces,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.8">the country of India and Media and Lydia. These they took from him and gave to Eumenes the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.9">The Greeks planned to come and destroy them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.10">but this became known to them, and they sent a general against the Greeks and attacked them. Many of them were wounded and fell, and the Romans took captive their wives and children; they plundered them, conquered the land, tore down their strongholds, and enslaved them to this day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.11">The remaining kingdoms and islands, as many as ever opposed them, they destroyed and enslaved;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.12">but with their friends and those who rely on them they have kept friendship. They have subdued kings far and near, and as many as have heard of their fame have feared them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.13">Those whom they wish to help and to make kings, they make kings, and those whom they wish they depose; and they have been greatly exalted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.14">Yet for all this not one of them has put on a crown or worn purple as a mark of pride,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.15">but they have built for themselves a senate chamber, and every day three hundred and twenty senators constantly deliberate concerning the people, to govern them well.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.16">They trust one man each year to rule over them and to control all their land; they all heed the one man, and there is no envy or jealousy among them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.17">So Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome to establish friendship and alliance,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.18">and to free themselves from the yoke; for they saw that the kingdom of the Greeks was completely enslaving Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.19">They went to Rome, a very long journey; and they entered the senate chamber and spoke as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.20">"Judas, who is also called Maccabeus, and his brothers and the people of the Jews have sent us to you to establish alliance and peace with you, that we may be enrolled as your allies and friends."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.21">The proposal pleased them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.22">and this is a copy of the letter which they wrote in reply, on bronze tablets, and sent to Jerusalem to remain with them there as a memorial of peace and alliance:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.23">"May all go well with the Romans and with the nation of the Jews at sea and on land for ever, and may sword and enemy be far from them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.24">If war comes first to Rome or to any of their allies in all their dominion,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.25">the nation of the Jews shall act as their allies wholeheartedly, as the occasion may indicate to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.26">And to the enemy who makes war they shall not give or supply grain, arms, money, or ships, as Rome has decided; and they shall keep their obligations without receiving any return.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.27">In the same way, if war comes first to the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall willingly act as their allies, as the occasion may indicate to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.28">And to the enemy allies shall be given no grain, arms, money, or ships, as Rome has decided; and they shall keep these obligations and do so without deceit.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.29">Thus on these terms the Romans make a treaty with the Jewish people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.30">If after these terms are in effect both parties shall determine to add or delete anything, they shall do so at their discretion, and any addition or deletion that they may make shall be valid.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.31">"And concerning the wrongs which King Demetrius is doing to them we have written to him as follows, `Why have you made your yoke heavy upon our friends and allies the Jews?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.8.32">If now they appeal again for help against you, we will defend their rights and fight you on sea and on land.'"</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Esd.9" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.1">When Demetrius heard that Nicanor and his army had fallen in battle, he sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judah a second time, and with them the right wing of the army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.2">They went by the road which leads to Gilgal and encamped against Mesaloth in Arbela, and they took it and killed many people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.3">In the first month of the one hundred and fifty-second year they encamped against Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.4">then they marched off and went to Berea with twenty thousand foot soldiers and two thousand cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.5">Now Judas was encamped in Elasa, and with him were three thousand picked men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.6">When they saw the huge number of the enemy forces, they were greatly frightened, and many slipped away from the camp, until no more than eight hundred of them were left.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.7">When Judas saw that his army had slipped away and the battle was imminent, he was crushed in spirit, for he had no time to assemble them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.8">He became faint, but he said to those who were left, "Let us rise and go up against our enemies. We may be able to fight them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.9">But they tried to dissuade him, saying, "We are not able. Let us rather save our own lives now, and let us come back with our brethren and fight them; we are too few."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.10">But Judas said, "Far be it from us to do such a thing as to flee from them. If our time has come, let us die bravely for our brethren, and leave no cause to question our honor."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.11">Then the army of Bacchides marched out from the camp and took its stand for the encounter. The cavalry was divided into two companies, and the slingers and the archers went ahead of the army, as did all the chief warriors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.12">Bacchides was on the right wing. Flanked by the two companies, the phalanx advanced to the sound of the trumpets; and the men with Judas also blew their trumpets.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.13">The earth was shaken by the noise of the armies, and the battle raged from morning till evening.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.14">Judas saw that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right; then all the stouthearted men went with him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.15">and they crushed the right wing, and he pursued them as far as Mount Azotus.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.16">When those on the left wing saw that the right wing was crushed, they turned and followed close behind Judas and his men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.17">The battle became desperate, and many on both sides were wounded and fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.18">Judas also fell, and the rest fled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.19">Then Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother and buried him in the tomb of their fathers at Modein,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.20">and wept for him. And all Israel made great lamentation for him; they mourned many days and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.21">"How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.22">Now the rest of the acts of Judas, and his wars and the brave deeds that he did, and his greatness, have not been recorded, for they were very many.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.23">After the death of Judas, the lawless emerged in all parts of Israel; all the doers of injustice appeared.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.24">In those days a very great famine occurred, and the country deserted with them to the enemy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.25">And Bacchides chose the ungodly and put them in charge of the country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.26">They sought and searched for the friends of Judas, and brought them to Bacchides, and he took vengeance on them and made sport of them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.27">Thus there was great distress in Israel, such as had not been since the time that prophets ceased to appear among them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.28">Then all the friends of Judas assembled and said to Jonathan,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.29">"Since the death of your brother Judas there has been no one like him to go against our enemies and Bacchides, and to deal with those of our nation who hate us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.30">So now we have chosen you today to take his place as our ruler and leader, to fight our battle."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.31">And Jonathan at that time accepted the leadership and took the place of Judas his brother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.32">When Bacchides learned of this, he tried to kill him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.33">But Jonathan and Simon his brother and all who were with him heard of it, and they fled into the wilderness of Tekoa and camped by the water of the pool of Asphar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.34">Bacchides found this out on the sabbath day, and he with all his army crossed the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.35">And Jonathan sent his brother as leader of the multitude and begged the Nabateans, who were his friends, for permission to store with them the great amount of baggage which they had.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.36">But the sons of Jambri from Medeba came out and seized John and all that he had, and departed with it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.37">After these things it was reported to Jonathan and Simon his brother, "The sons of Jambri are celebrating a great wedding, and are conducting the bride, a daughter of one of the great nobles of Canaan, from Nadabath with a large escort."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.38">And they remembered the blood of John their brother, and went up and hid under cover of the mountain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.39">They raised their eyes and looked, and saw a tumultuous procession with much baggage; and the bridegroom came out with his friends and his brothers to meet them with tambourines and musicians and many weapons.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.40">Then they rushed upon them from the ambush and began killing them. Many were wounded and fell, and the rest fled to the mountain; and they took all their goods.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.41">Thus the wedding was turned into mourning and the voice of their musicians into a funeral dirge.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.42">And when they had fully avenged the blood of their brother, they returned to the marshes of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.43">When Bacchides heard of this, he came with a large force on the sabbath day to the banks of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.44">And Jonathan said to those with him, "Let us rise up now and fight for our lives, for today things are not as they were before.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.45">For look! the battle is in front of us and behind us; the water of the Jordan is on this side and on that, with marsh and thicket; there is no place to turn.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.46">Cry out now to Heaven that you may be delivered from the hands of our enemies."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.47">So the battle began, and Jonathan stretched out his hand to strike Bacchides, but he eluded him and went to the rear.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.48">Then Jonathan and the men with him leaped into the Jordan and swam across to the other side, and the enemy did not cross the Jordan to attack them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.49">And about one thousand of Bacchides' men fell that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.50">Bacchides then returned to Jerusalem and built strong cities in Judea: the fortress in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Beth-horon, and Bethel, and Timnath, and Pharathon, and Tephon, with high walls and gates and bars.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.51">And he placed garrisons in them to harass Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.52">He also fortified the city of Beth-zur, and Gazara, and the citadel, and in them he put troops and stores of food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.53">And he took the sons of the leading men of the land as hostages and put them under guard in the citadel at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.54">In the one hundred and fifty-third year, in the second month, Alcimus gave orders to tear down the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary. He tore down the work of the prophets!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.55">But he only began to tear it down, for at that time Alcimus was stricken and his work was hindered; his mouth was stopped and he was paralyzed, so that he could no longer say a word or give commands concerning his house.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.56">And Alcimus died at that time in great agony.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.57">When Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king, and the land of Judah had rest for two years.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.58">Then all the lawless plotted and said, "See! Jonathan and his men are living in quiet and confidence. So now let us bring Bacchides back, and he will capture them all in one night."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.59">And they went and consulted with him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.60">He started to come with a large force, and secretly sent letters to all his allies in Judea, telling them to seize Jonathan and his men; but they were unable to do it, because their plan became known.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.61">And Jonathan's men seized about fifty of the men of the country who were leaders in this treachery, and killed them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.62">Then Jonathan with his men, and Simon, withdrew to Bethbasi in the wilderness; he rebuilt the parts of it that had been demolished, and they fortified it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.63">When Bacchides learned of this, he assembled all his forces, and sent orders to the men of Judea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.64">Then he came and encamped against Bethbasi; he fought against it for many days and made machines of war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.65">But Jonathan left Simon his brother in the city, while he went out into the country; and he went with only a few men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.66">He struck down Odomera and his brothers and the sons of Phasiron in their tents.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.67">Then he began to attack and went into battle with his forces; and Simon and his men sallied out from the city and set fire to the machines of war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.68">They fought with Bacchides, and he was crushed by them. They distressed him greatly, for his plan and his expedition had been in vain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.69">So he was greatly enraged at the lawless men who had counseled him to come into the country, and he killed many of them. Then he decided to depart to his own land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.70">When Jonathan learned of this, he sent ambassadors to him to make peace with him and obtain release of the captives.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.71">He agreed, and did as he said; and he swore to Jonathan that he would not try to harm him as long as he lived.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.72">He restored to him the captives whom he had formerly taken from the land of Judah; then he turned and departed to his own land, and came no more into their territory.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.9.73">Thus the sword ceased from Israel. And Jonathan dwelt in Michmash. And Jonathan began to judge the people, and he destroyed the ungodly out of Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Esd.10" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.1">In the one hundred and sixtieth year Alexander Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus, landed and occupied Ptolemais. They welcomed him, and there he began to reign.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.2">When Demetrius the king heard of it, he assembled a very large army and marched out to meet him in battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.3">And Demetrius sent Jonathan a letter in peaceable words to honor him;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.4">for he said, "Let us act first to make peace with him before he makes peace with Alexander against us,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.5">for he will remember all the wrongs which we did to him and to his brothers and his nation."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.6">So Demetrius gave him authority to recruit troops, to equip them with arms, and to become his ally; and he commanded that the hostages in the citadel should be released to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.7">Then Jonathan came to Jerusalem and read the letter in the hearing of all the people and of the men in the citadel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.8">They were greatly alarmed when they heard that the king had given him authority to recruit troops.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.9">But the men in the citadel released the hostages to Jonathan, and he returned them to their parents.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.10">And Jonathan dwelt in Jerusalem and began to rebuild and restore the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.11">He directed those who were doing the work to build the walls and encircle Mount Zion with squared stones, for better fortification; and they did so.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.12">Then the foreigners who were in the strongholds that Bacchides had built fled;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.13">each left his place and departed to his own land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.14">Only in Beth-zur did some remain who had forsaken the law and the commandments, for it served as a place of refuge.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.15">Now Alexander the king heard of all the promises which Demetrius had sent to Jonathan, and men told him of the battles that Jonathan and his brothers had fought, of the brave deeds that they had done, and of the troubles that they had endured.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.16">So he said, "Shall we find another such man? Come now, we will make him our friend and ally."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.17">And he wrote a letter and sent it to him, in the following words:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.18">"King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.19">We have heard about you, that you are a mighty warrior and worthy to be our friend.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.20">And so we have appointed you today to be the high priest of your nation; you are to be called the king's friend" (and he sent him a purple robe and a golden crown) "and you are to take our side and keep friendship with us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.21">So Jonathan put on the holy garments in the seventh month of the one hundred and sixtieth year, at the feast of tabernacles, and he recruited troops and equipped them with arms in abundance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.22">When Demetrius heard of these things he was grieved and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.23">"What is this that we have done? Alexander has gotten ahead of us in forming a friendship with the Jews to strengthen himself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.24">I also will write them words of encouragement and promise them honor and gifts, that I may have their help."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.25">So he sent a message to them in the following words: "King Demetrius to the nation of the Jews, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.26">Since you have kept your agreement with us and have continued your friendship with us, and have not sided with our enemies, we have heard of it and rejoiced.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.27">And now continue still to keep faith with us, and we will repay you with good for what you do for us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.28">We will grant you many immunities and give you gifts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.29">"And now I free you and exempt all the Jews from payment of tribute and salt tax and crown levies,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.30">and instead of collecting the third of the grain and the half of the fruit of the trees that I should receive, I release them from this day and henceforth. I will not collect them from the land of Judah or from the three districts added to it from Samaria and Galilee, from this day and for all time.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.31">And let Jerusalem and her environs, her tithes and her revenues, be holy and free from tax.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.32">I release also my control of the citadel in Jerusalem and give it to the high priest, that he may station in it men of his own choice to guard it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.33">And every one of the Jews taken as a captive from the land of Judah into any part of my kingdom, I set free without payment; and let all officials cancel also the taxes on their cattle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.34">"And all the feasts and sabbaths and new moons and appointed days, and the three days before a feast and the three after a feast -- let them all be days of immunity and release for all the Jews who are in my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.35">No one shall have authority to exact anything from them or annoy any of them about any matter.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.36">"Let Jews be enrolled in the king's forces to the number of thirty thousand men, and let the maintenance be given them that is due to all the forces of the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.37">Let some of them be stationed in the great strongholds of the king, and let some of them be put in positions of trust in the kingdom. Let their officers and leaders be of their own number, and let them live by their own laws, just as the king has commanded in the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.38">"As for the three districts that have been added to Judea from the country of Samaria, let them be so annexed to Judea that they are considered to be under one ruler and obey no other authority but the high priest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.39">Ptolemais and the land adjoining it I have given as a gift to the sanctuary in Jerusalem, to meet the necessary expenses of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.40">I also grant fifteen thousand shekels of silver yearly out of the king's revenues from appropriate places.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.41">And all the additional funds which the government officials have not paid as they did in the first years, they shall give from now on for the service of the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.42">Moreover, the five thousand shekels of silver which my officials have received every year from the income of the services of the temple, this too is canceled, because it belongs to the priests who minister there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.43">And whoever takes refuge at the temple in Jerusalem, or in any of its precincts, because he owes money to the king or has any debt, let him be released and receive back all his property in my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.44">"Let the cost of rebuilding and restoring the structures of the sanctuary be paid from the revenues of the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.45">And let the cost of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and fortifying it round about, and the cost of rebuilding the walls in Judea, also be paid from the revenues of the king."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.46">When Jonathan and the people heard these words, they did not believe or accept them, because they remembered the great wrongs which Demetrius had done in Israel and how he had greatly oppressed them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.47">They favored Alexander, because he had been the first to speak peaceable words to them, and they remained his allies all his days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.48">Now Alexander the king assembled large forces and encamped opposite Demetrius.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.49">The two kings met in battle, and the army of Demetrius fled, and Alexander pursued him and defeated them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.50">He pressed the battle strongly until the sun set, and Demetrius fell on that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.51">Then Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemy king of Egypt with the following message:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.52">"Since I have returned to my kingdom and have taken my seat on the throne of my fathers, and established my rule -- for I crushed Demetrius and gained control of our country;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.53">I met him in battle, and he and his army were crushed by us, and we have taken our seat on the throne of his kingdom --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.54">now therefore let us establish friendship with one another; give me now your daughter as my wife, and I will become your son-in-law, and will make gifts to you and to her in keeping with your position."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.55">Ptolemy the king replied and said, "Happy was the day on which you returned to the land of your fathers and took your seat on the throne of their kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.56">And now I will do for you as you wrote, but meet me at Ptolemais, so that we may see one another, and I will become your father-in-law, as you have said."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.57">So Ptolemy set out from Egypt, he and Cleopatra his daughter, and came to Ptolemais in the one hundred and sixty-second year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.58">Alexander the king met him, and Ptolemy gave him Cleopatra his daughter in marriage, and celebrated her wedding at Ptolemais with great pomp, as kings do.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.59">Then Alexander the king wrote to Jonathan to come to meet him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.60">So he went with pomp to Ptolemais and met the two kings; he gave them and their friends silver and gold and many gifts, and found favor with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.61">A group of pestilent men from Israel, lawless men, gathered together against him to accuse him; but the king paid no attention to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.62">The king gave orders to take off Jonathan's garments and to clothe him in purple, and they did so.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.63">The king also seated him at his side; and he said to his officers, "Go forth with him into the middle of the city and proclaim that no one is to bring charges against him about any matter, and let no one annoy him for any reason."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.64">And when his accusers saw the honor that was paid him, in accordance with the proclamation, and saw him clothed in purple, they all fled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.65">Thus the king honored him and enrolled him among his chief friends, and made him general and governor of the province.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.66">And Jonathan returned to Jerusalem in peace and gladness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.67">In the one hundred and sixty-fifth year Demetrius the son of Demetrius came from Crete to the land of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.68">When Alexander the king heard of it, he was greatly grieved and returned to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.69">And Demetrius appointed Apollonius the governor of Coelesyria, and he assembled a large force and encamped against Jamnia. Then he sent the following message to Jonathan the high priest:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.70">"You are the only one to rise up against us, and I have become a laughingstock and reproach because of you. Why do you assume authority against us in the hill country?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.71">If you now have confidence in your forces, come down to the plain to meet us, and let us match strength with each other there, for I have with me the power of the cities.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.72">Ask and learn who I am and who the others are that are helping us. Men will tell you that you cannot stand before us, for your fathers were twice put to flight in their own land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.73">And now you will not be able to withstand my cavalry and such an army in the plain, where there is no stone or pebble, or place to flee."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.74">When Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, his spirit was aroused. He chose ten thousand men and set out from Jerusalem, and Simon his brother met him to help him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.75">He encamped before Joppa, but the men of the city closed its gates, for Apollonius had a garrison in Joppa.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.76">So they fought against it, and the men of the city became afraid and opened the gates, and Jonathan gained possession of Joppa.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.77">When Apollonius heard of it, he mustered three thousand cavalry and a large army, and went to Azotus as though he were going farther. At the same time he advanced into the plain, for he had a large troop of cavalry and put confidence in it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.78">Jonathan pursued him to Azotus, and the armies engaged in battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.79">Now Apollonius had secretly left a thousand cavalry behind them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.80">Jonathan learned that there was an ambush behind him, for they surrounded his army and shot arrows at his men from early morning till late afternoon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.81">But his men stood fast, as Jonathan commanded, and the enemy's horses grew tired.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.82">Then Simon brought forward his force and engaged the phalanx in battle (for the cavalry was exhausted); they were overwhelmed by him and fled,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.83">and the cavalry was dispersed in the plain. They fled to Azotus and entered Beth-dagon, the temple of their idol, for safety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.84">But Jonathan burned Azotus and the surrounding towns and plundered them; and the temple of Dagon, and those who had taken refuge in it he burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.85">The number of those who fell by the sword, with those burned alive, came to eight thousand men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.86">Then Jonathan departed from there and encamped against Askalon, and the men of the city came out to meet him with great pomp.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.87">And Jonathan and those with him returned to Jerusalem with much booty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.88">When Alexander the king heard of these things, he honored Jonathan still more;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.10.89">and he sent to him a golden buckle, such as it is the custom to give to the kinsmen of kings. He also gave him Ekron and all its environs as his possession.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Esd.11" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.1">Then the king of Egypt gathered great forces, like the sand by the seashore, and many ships; and he tried to get possession of Alexander's kingdom by trickery and add it to his own kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.2">He set out for Syria with peaceable words, and the people of the cities opened their gates to him and went to meet him, for Alexander the king had commanded them to meet him, since he was Alexander's father-in-law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.3">But when Ptolemy entered the cities he stationed forces as a garrison in each city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.4">When he approached Azotus, they showed him the temple of Dagon burned down, and Azotus and its suburbs destroyed, and the corpses lying about, and the charred bodies of those whom Jonathan had burned in the war, for they had piled them in heaps along his route.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.5">They also told the king what Jonathan had done, to throw blame on him; but the king kept silent.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.6">Jonathan met the king at Joppa with pomp, and they greeted one another and spent the night there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.7">And Jonathan went with the king as far as the river called Eleutherus; then he returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.8">So King Ptolemy gained control of the coastal cities as far as Seleucia by the sea, and he kept devising evil designs against Alexander.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.9">He sent envoys to Demetrius the king, saying, "Come, let us make a covenant with each other, and I will give you in marriage my daughter who was Alexander's wife, and you shall reign over your father's kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.10">For I now regret that I gave him my daughter, for he has tried to kill me."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.11">He threw blame on Alexander because he coveted his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.12">So he took his daughter away from him and gave her to Demetrius. He was estranged from Alexander, and their enmity became manifest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.13">Then Ptolemy entered Antioch and put on the crown of Asia. Thus he put two crowns upon his head, the crown of Egypt and that of Asia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.14">Now Alexander the king was in Cilicia at that time, because the people of that region were in revolt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.15">And Alexander heard of it and came against him in battle. Ptolemy marched out and met him with a strong force, and put him to flight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.16">So Alexander fled into Arabia to find protection there, and King Ptolemy was exalted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.17">And Zabdiel the Arab cut off the head of Alexander and sent it to Ptolemy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.18">But King Ptolemy died three days later, and his troops in the strongholds were killed by the inhabitants of the strongholds.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.19">So Demetrius became king in the one hundred and sixty-seventh year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.20">In those days Jonathan assembled the men of Judea to attack the citadel in Jerusalem, and he built many engines of war to use against it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.21">But certain lawless men who hated their nation went to the king and reported to him that Jonathan was besieging the citadel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.22">When he heard this he was angry, and as soon as he heard it he set out and came to Ptolemais; and he wrote Jonathan not to continue the siege, but to meet him for a conference at Ptolemais as quickly as possible.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.23">When Jonathan heard this, he gave orders to continue the siege; and he chose some of the elders of Israel and some of the priests, and put himself in danger,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.24">for he went to the king at Ptolemais, taking silver and gold and clothing and numerous other gifts. And he won his favor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.25">Although certain lawless men of his nation kept making complaints against him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.26">the king treated him as his predecessors had treated him; he exalted him in the presence of all his friends.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.27">He confirmed him in the high priesthood and in as many other honors as he had formerly had, and made him to be regarded as one of his chief friends.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.28">Then Jonathan asked the king to free Judea and the three districts of Samaria from tribute, and promised him three hundred talents.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.29">The king consented, and wrote a letter to Jonathan about all these things; its contents were as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.30">"King Demetrius to Jonathan his brother and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.31">This copy of the letter which we wrote concerning you to Lasthenes our kinsman we have written to you also, so that you may know what it says.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.32">`King Demetrius to Lasthenes his father, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.33">To the nation of the Jews, who are our friends and fulfil their obligations to us, we have determined to do good, because of the good will they show toward us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.34">We have confirmed as their possession both the territory of Judea and the three districts of Aphairema and Lydda and Rathamin; the latter, with all the region bordering them, were added to Judea from Samaria. To all those who offer sacrifice in Jerusalem, we have granted release from the royal taxes which the king formerly received from them each year, from the crops of the land and the fruit of the trees.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.35">And the other payments henceforth due to us of the tithes, and the taxes due to us, and the salt pits and the crown taxes due to us -- from all these we shall grant them release.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.36">And not one of these grants shall be canceled from this time forth for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.37">Now therefore take care to make a copy of this, and let it be given to Jonathan and put up in a conspicuous place on the holy mountain.'"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.38">Now when Demetrius the king saw that the land was quiet before him and that there was no opposition to him, he dismissed all his troops, each man to his own place, except the foreign troops which he had recruited from the islands of the nations. So all the troops who had served his fathers hated him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.39">Now Trypho had formerly been one of Alexander's supporters. He saw that all the troops were murmuring against Demetrius. So he went to Imalkue the Arab, who was bringing up Antiochus, the young son of Alexander,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.40">and insistently urged him to hand Antiochus over to him, to become king in place of his father. He also reported to Imalkue what Demetrius had done and told of the hatred which the troops of Demetrius had for him; and he stayed there many days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.41">Now Jonathan sent to Demetrius the king the request that he remove the troops of the citadel from Jerusalem, and the troops in the strongholds; for they kept fighting against Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.42">And Demetrius sent this message to Jonathan, "Not only will I do these things for you and your nation, but I will confer great honor on you and your nation, if I find an opportunity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.43">Now then you will do well to send me men who will help me, for all my troops have revolted."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.44">So Jonathan sent three thousand stalwart men to him at Antioch, and when they came to the king, the king rejoiced at their arrival.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.45">Then the men of the city assembled within the city, to the number of a hundred and twenty thousand, and they wanted to kill the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.46">But the king fled into the palace. Then the men of the city seized the main streets of the city and began to fight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.47">So the king called the Jews to his aid, and they all rallied about him and then spread out through the city; and they killed on that day as many as a hundred thousand men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.48">They set fire to the city and seized much spoil on that day, and they saved the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.49">When the men of the city saw that the Jews had gained control of the city as they pleased, their courage failed and they cried out to the king with this entreaty,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.50">"Grant us peace, and make the Jews stop fighting against us and our city."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.51">And they threw down their arms and made peace. So the Jews gained glory in the eyes of the king and of all the people in his kingdom, and they returned to Jerusalem with much spoil.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.52">So Demetrius the king sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.53">But he broke his word about all that he had promised; and he became estranged from Jonathan and did not repay the favors which Jonathan had done him, but oppressed him greatly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.54">After this Trypho returned, and with him the young boy Antiochus who began to reign and put on the crown.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.55">All the troops that Demetrius had cast off gathered around him, and they fought against Demetrius, and he fled and was routed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.56">And Trypho captured the elephants and gained control of Antioch.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.57">Then the young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, "I confirm you in the high priesthood and set you over the four districts and make you one of the friends of the king."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.58">And he sent him gold plate and a table service, and granted him the right to drink from gold cups and dress in purple and wear a gold buckle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.59">Simon his brother he made governor from the Ladder of Tyre to the borders of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.60">Then Jonathan set forth and traveled beyond the river and among the cities, and all the army of Syria gathered to him as allies. When he came to Askalon, the people of the city met him and paid him honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.61">From there he departed to Gaza, but the men of Gaza shut him out. So he beseiged it and burned its suburbs with fire and plundered them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.62">Then the people of Gaza pleaded with Jonathan, and he made peace with them, and took the sons of their rulers as hostages and sent them to Jerusalem. And he passed through the country as far as Damascus.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.63">Then Jonathan heard that the officers of Demetrius had come to Kadesh in Galilee with a large army, intending to remove him from office.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.64">He went to meet them, but left his brother Simon in the country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.65">Simon encamped before Beth-zur and fought against it for many days and hemmed it in.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.66">Then they asked him to grant them terms of peace, and he did so. He removed them from there, took possession of the city, and set a garrison over it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.67">Jonathan and his army encamped by the waters of Gennesaret. Early in the morning they marched to the plain of Hazor,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.68">and behold, the army of the foreigners met him in the plain; they had set an ambush against him in the mountains, but they themselves met him face to face.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.69">Then the men in ambush emerged from their places and joined battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.70">All the men with Jonathan fled; not one of them was left except Mattathias the son of Absalom and Judas the son of Chalphi, commanders of the forces of the army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.71">Jonathan rent his garments and put dust on his head, and prayed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.72">Then he turned back to the battle against the enemy and routed them, and they fled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.73">When his men who were fleeing saw this, they returned to him and joined him in the pursuit as far as Kadesh, to their camp, and there they encamped.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.11.74">As many as three thousand of the foreigners fell that day. And Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Esd.12" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.1">Now when Jonathan saw that the time was favorable for him, he chose men and sent them to Rome to confirm and renew the friendship with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.2">He also sent letters to the same effect to the Spartans and to other places.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.3">So they went to Rome and entered the senate chamber and said, "Jonathan the high priest and the Jewish nation have sent us to renew the former friendship and alliance with them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.4">And the Romans gave them letters to the people in every place, asking them to provide for the envoys safe conduct to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.5">This is a copy of the letter which Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.6">"Jonathan the high priest, the senate of the nation, the priests, and the rest of the Jewish people to their brethren the Spartans, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.7">Already in time past a letter was sent to Onias the high priest from Arius, who was king among you, stating that you are our brethren, as the appended copy shows.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.8">Onias welcomed the envoy with honor, and received the letter, which contained a clear declaration of alliance and friendship.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.9">Therefore, though we have no need of these things, since we have as encouragement the holy books which are in our hands,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.10">we have undertaken to send to renew our brotherhood and friendship with you, so that we may not become estranged from you, for considerable time has passed since you sent your letter to us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.11">We therefore remember you constantly on every occasion, both in our feasts and on other appropriate days, at the sacrifices which we offer and in our prayers, as it is right and proper to remember brethren.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.12">And we rejoice in your glory.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.13">But as for ourselves, many afflictions and many wars have encircled us; the kings round about us have waged war against us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.14">We were unwilling to annoy you and our other allies and friends with these wars,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.15">for we have the help which comes from Heaven for our aid; and we were delivered from our enemies and our enemies were humbled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.16">We therefore have chosen Numenius the son of Antiochus and Antipater the son of Jason, and have sent them to Rome to renew our former friendship and alli   ance with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.17">We have commanded them to go also to you and greet you and deliver to you this letter from us concerning the renewal of our brotherhood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.18">And now please send us a reply to this."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.19">This is a copy of the letter which they sent to Onias:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.20">"Arius, king of the Spartans, to Onias the high priest, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.21">It has been found in writing concerning the Spartans and the Jews that they are brethren and are of the family of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.22">And now that we have learned this, please write us concerning your welfare;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.23">we on our part write to you that your cattle and your property belong to us, and ours belong to you. We therefore command that our envoys report to you accordingly."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.24">Now Jonathan heard that the commanders of Demetrius had returned, with a larger force than before, to wage war against him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.25">So he marched away from Jerusalem and met them in the region of Hamath, for he gave them no opportunity to invade his own country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.26">He sent spies to their camp, and they returned and reported to him that the enemy were being drawn up in formation to fall upon the Jews by night.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.27">So when the sun set, Jonathan commanded his men to be alert and to keep their arms at hand so as to be ready all night for battle, and he stationed outposts around the camp.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.28">When the enemy heard that Jonathan and his men were prepared for battle, they were afraid and were terrified at heart; so they kindled fires in their camp and withdrew.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.29">But Jonathan and his men did not know it until morning, for they saw the fires burning.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.30">Then Jonathan pursued them, but he did not overtake them, for they had crossed the Eleutherus river.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.31">So Jonathan turned aside against the Arabs who are called Zabadeans, and he crushed them and plundered them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.32">Then he broke camp and went to Damascus, and marched through all that region.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.33">Simon also went forth and marched through the country as far as Askalon and the neighboring strongholds. He turned aside to Joppa and took it by surprise,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.34">for he had heard that they were ready to hand over the stronghold to the men whom Demetrius had sent. And he stationed a garrison there to guard it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.35">When Jonathan returned he convened the elders of the people and planned with them to build strongholds in Judea,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.36">to build the walls of Jerusalem still higher, and to erect a high barrier between the citadel and the city to separate it from the city, in order to isolate it so that its garrison could neither buy nor sell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.37">So they gathered together to build up the city; part of the wall on the valley to the east had fallen, and he repaired the section called Chaphenatha.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.38">And Simon built Adida in the Shephelah; he fortified it and installed gates with bolts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.39">Then Trypho attempted to become king in Asia and put on the crown, and to raise his hand against Antiochus the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.40">He feared that Jonathan might not permit him to do so, but might make war on him, so he kept seeking to seize and kill him, and he marched forth and came to Beth-shan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.41">Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand picked fighting men, and he came to Beth-shan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.42">When Trypho saw that he had come with a large army, he was afraid to raise his hand against him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.43">So he received him with honor and commended him to all his friends, and he gave him gifts and commanded his friends and his troops to obey him as they would himself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.44">Then he said to Jonathan, "Why have you wearied all these people when we are not at war?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.45">Dismiss them now to their homes and choose for yourself a few men to stay with you, and come with me to Ptolemais. I will hand it over to you as well as the other strongholds and the remaining troops and all the officials, and will turn round and go home. For that is why I am here."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.46">Jonathan trusted him and did as he said; he sent away the troops, and they returned to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.47">He kept with himself three thousand men, two thousand of whom he left in Galilee, while a thousand accompanied him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.48">But when Jonathan entered Ptolemais, the men of Ptolemais closed the gates and seized him, and all who had entered with him they killed with the sword.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.49">Then Trypho sent troops and cavalry into Galilee and the Great Plain to destroy all Jonathan's soldiers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.50">But they realized that Jonathan had been seized and had perished along with his men, and they encouraged one another and kept marching in close formation, ready for battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.51">When their pursuers saw that they would fight for their lives, they turned back.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.52">So they all reached the land of Judah safely, and they mourned for Jonathan and his companions and were in great fear; and all Israel mourned deeply.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.12.53">And all the nations round about them tried to destroy them, for they said, "They have no leader or helper. Now therefore let us make war on them and blot out the memory of them from among men."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Esd.13" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.1">Simon heard that Trypho had assembled a large army to invade the land of Judah and destroy it,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.2">and he saw that the people were trembling and fearful. So he went up to Jerusalem, and gathering the people together</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.3">he encouraged them, saying to them, "You yourselves know what great things I and my brothers and the house of my father have done for the laws and the sanctuary; you know also the wars and the difficulties which we have seen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.4">By reason of this all my brothers have perished for the sake of Israel, and I alone am left.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.5">And now, far be it from me to spare my life in any time of distress, for I am not better than my brothers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.6">But I will avenge my nation and the sanctuary and your wives and children, for all the nations have gathered together out of hatred to destroy us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.7">The spirit of the people was rekindled when they heard these words,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.10">So he assembled all the warriors and hastened to complete the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it on every side.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.11">He sent Jonathan the son of Absalom to Joppa, and with him a considerable army; he drove out its occupants and remained there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.12">Then Trypho departed from Ptolemais with a large army to invade the land of Judah, and Jonathan was with him under guard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.13">And Simon encamped in Adida, facing the plain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.14">Trypho learned that Simon had risen up in place of Jonathan his brother, and that he was about to join battle with him, so he sent envoys to him and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.15">"It is for the money that Jonathan your brother owed the royal treasury, in connection with the offices he held, that we are detaining him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.16">Send now a hundred talents of silver and two of his sons as hostages, so that when released he will not revolt against us, and we will release him."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.17">Simon knew that they were speaking deceitfully to him, but he sent to get the money and the sons, lest he arouse great hostility among the people, who might say,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.18">"Because Simon did not send him the money and the sons, he perished."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.19">So he sent the sons and the hundred talents, but Trypho broke his word and did not release Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.20">After this Trypho came to invade the country and destroy it, and he circled around by the way to Adora. But Simon and his army kept marching along opposite him to every place he went.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.21">Now the men in the citadel kept sending envoys to Trypho urging him to come to them by way of the wilderness and to send them food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.22">So Trypho got all his cavalry ready to go, but that night a very heavy snow fell, and he did not go because of the snow. He marched off and went into the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.23">When he approached Baskama, he killed Jonathan, and he was buried there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.24">Then Trypho turned back and departed to his own land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.25">And Simon sent and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried him in Modein, the city of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.26">All Israel bewailed him with great lamentation, and mourned for him many days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.27">And Simon built a monument over the tomb of his father and his brothers; he made it high that it might be seen, with polished stone at the front and back.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.28">He also erected seven pyramids, opposite one another, for his father and mother and four brothers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.29">And for the pyramids he devised an elaborate setting, erecting about them great columns, and upon the columns he put suits of armor for a permanent memorial, and beside the suits of armor carved ships, so that they could be seen by all who sail the sea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.30">This is the tomb which he built in Modein; it remains to this day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.31">Trypho dealt treacherously with the young king Antiochus; he killed him</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.32">and became king in his place, putting on the crown of Asia; and he brought great calamity upon the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.33">But Simon built up the strongholds of Judea and walled them all around, with high towers and great walls and gates and bolts, and he stored food in the strongholds.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.34">Simon also chose men and sent them to Demetrius the king with a request to grant relief to the country, for all that Trypho did was to plunder.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.35">Demetrius the king sent him a favorable reply to this request, and wrote him a letter as follows,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.36">"King Demetrius to Simon, the high priest and friend of kings, and to the elders and nation of the Jews, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.37">We have received the gold crown and the palm branch which you sent, and we are ready to make a general peace with you and to write to our officials to grant you release from tribute.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.38">All the grants that we have made to you remain valid, and let the strongholds that you have built be your possession.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.39">We pardon any errors and offenses committed to this day, and cancel the crown tax which you owe; and whatever other tax has been collected in Jerusalem shall be collected no longer.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.40">And if any of you are qualified to be enrolled in our bodyguard, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.41">In the one hundred and seventieth year the yoke of the Gentiles was removed from Israel,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.42">and the people began to write in their documents and contracts, "In the first year of Simon the great high priest and commander and leader of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.43">In those days Simon encamped against Gazara and surrounded it with troops. He made a siege engine, brought it up to the city, and battered and captured one tower.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.44">The men in the siege engine leaped out into the city, and a great tumult arose in the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.45">The men in the city, with their wives and children, went up on the wall with their clothes rent, and they cried out with a loud voice, asking Simon to make peace with them;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.46">they said, "Do not treat us according to our wicked acts but according to your mercy."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.47">So Simon reached an agreement with them and stopped fighting against them. But he expelled them from the city and cleansed the houses in which the idols were, and then entered it with hymns and praise.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.48">He cast out of it all uncleanness, and settled in it men who observed the law. He also strengthened its fortifications and built in it a house for himself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.49">The men in the citadel at Jerusalem were prevented from going out to the country and back to buy and sell. So they were very hungry, and many of them perished from famine.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.50">Then they cried to Simon to make peace with them, and he did so. But he expelled them from there and cleansed the citadel from its pollutions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.51">On the twenty-third day of the second month, in the one hundred and seventy-first year, the Jews entered it with praise and palm branches, and with harps and cymbals and stringed instruments, and with hymns and songs, because a great enemy had been crushed and removed from Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.52">And Simon decreed that every year they should celebrate this day with rejoicing. He strengthened the fortifications of the temple hill alongside the citadel, and he and his men dwelt there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.13.53">And Simon saw that John his son had reached manhood, so he made him commander of all the forces, and he dwelt in Gazara.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.2">When Arsaces the king of Persia and Media heard that Demetrius had invaded his territory, he sent one of his commanders to take him alive.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.3">And he went and defeated the army of Demetrius, and seized him and took him to Arsaces, who put him under guard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.4">The land had rest all the days of Simon. He sought the good of his nation; his rule was pleasing to them, as was the honor shown him, all his days.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.15">He made the sanctuary glorious, and added to the vessels of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.16">It was heard in Rome, and as far away as Sparta, that Jonathan had died, and they were deeply grieved.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.17">When they heard that Simon his brother had become high priest in his place, and that he was ruling over the country and the cities in it,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.23">It has pleased our people to receive these men with honor and to put a copy of their words in the public archives, so that the people of the Spartans may have a record of them. And they have sent a copy of this to Simon the high priest.'"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.24">After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a large gold shield weighing a thousand minas, to confirm the alliance with the Romans.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.27">So they made a record on bronze tablets and put it upon pillars on Mount Zion. This is a copy of what they wrote: "On the eighteenth day of Elul, in the one hundred and seventy-second year, which is the third year of Simon the great high priest,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.28">in Asaramel, in the great assembly of the priests and the people and the rulers of the nation and the elders of the country, the following was proclaimed to us:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.29">"Since wars often occurred in the country, Simon the son of Mattathias, a priest of the sons of Joarib, and his brothers, exposed themselves to danger and resisted the enemies of their nation, in order that their sanctuary and the law might be perserved; and they brought great glory to their nation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.30">Jonathan rallied the nation, and became their high priest, and was gathered to his people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.31">And when their enemies decided to invade their country and lay hands on their sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.32">then Simon rose up and fought for his nation. He spent great sums of his own money; he armed the men of his nation's forces and paid them wages.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.33">He fortified the cities of Judea, and Beth-zur on the borders of Judea, where formerly the arms of the enemy had been stored, and he placed there a garrison of Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.34">He also fortified Joppa, which is by the sea, and Gazara, which is on the borders of Azotus, where the enemy formerly dwelt. He settled Jews there, and provided in those cities whatever was necessary for their restoration.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.35">"The people saw Simon's faithfulness and the glory which he had resolved to win for his nation, and they made him their leader and high priest, because he had done all these things and because of the justice and loyalty which he had maintained toward his nation. He sought in every way to exalt his people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.36">And in his days things prospered in his hands, so that the Gentiles were put out of the country, as were also the men in the city of David in Jerusalem, who had built themselves a citadel from which they used to sally forth and defile the environs of the sanctuary and do great damage to its purity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.37">He settled Jews in it, and fortified it for the safety of the country and of the city, and built the walls of Jerusalem higher.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.38">"In view of these things King Demetrius confirmed him in the high priesthood,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.39">and he made him one of the king's friends and paid him high honors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.40">For he had heard that the Jews were addressed by the Romans as friends and allies and brethren, and that the Romans had received the envoys of Simon with honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.41">"And the Jews and their priests decided that Simon should be their leader and high priest for ever, until a trustworthy prophet should arise,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.42">and that he should be governor over them and that he should take charge of the sanctuary and appoint men over its tasks and over the country and the weapons and the strongholds, and that he should take charge of the sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.43">and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all contracts in the country should be written in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple and wear gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.44">"And none of the people or priests shall be permitted to nullify any of these decisions or to oppose what he says, or to convene an assembly in the country without his permission, or to be clothed in purple or put on a gold buckle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.45">Whoever acts contrary to these decisions or nullifies any of them shall be liable to punishment."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.46">And all the people agreed to grant Simon the right to act in accord with these decisions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.47">So Simon accepted and agreed to be high priest, to be commander and ethnarch of the Jews and priests, and to be protector of them all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.14.48">And they gave orders to inscribe this decree upon bronze tablets, to put them up in a conspicuous place in the precincts of the sanctuary,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.9">When we gain control of our kingdom, we will bestow great honor upon you and your nation and the temple, so that your glory will become manifest in all the earth."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.10">In the one hundred and seventy-fourth year Antiochus set out and invaded the land of his fathers. All the troops rallied to him, so that there were few with Trypho.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.11">Antiochus pursued him, and he came in his flight to Dor, which is by the sea;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.12">for he knew that troubles had converged upon him, and his troops had deserted him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.13">So Antiochus encamped against Dor, and with him were a hundred and twenty thousand warriors and eight thousand cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.14">He surrounded the city, and the ships joined battle from the sea; he pressed the city hard from land and sea, and permitted no one to leave or enter it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.15">Then Numenius and his companions arrived from Rome, with letters to the kings and countries, in which the following was written:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.16">"Lucius, consul of the Romans, to King Ptolemy, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.17">The envoys of the Jews have come to us as our friends and allies to renew our ancient friendship and alliance. They had been sent by Simon the high priest and by the people of the Jews,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.19">We therefore have decided to write to the kings and countries that they should not seek their harm or make war against them and their cities and their country, or make alliance with those who war against them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.20">And it has seemed good to us to accept the shield from them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.21">Therefore if any pestilent men have fled to you from their country, hand them over to Simon the high priest, that he may punish them according to their law."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.22">The consul wrote the same thing to Demetrius the king and to Attalus and Ariarathes and Arsaces,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.23">and to all the countries, and to Sampsames, and to the Spartans, and to Delos, and to Myndos, and to Sicyon, and to Caria, and to Samos, and to Pamphylia, and to Lycia, and to Halicarnassus, and to Rhodes, and to Phaselis, and to Cos, and to Side, and to Aradus and Gortyna and Cnidus and Cyprus and Cyrene.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.25">Antiochus the king besieged Dor anew, continually throwing his forces against it and making engines of war; and he shut Trypho up and kept him from going out or in.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.26">And Simon sent to Antiochus two thousand picked men, to fight for him, and silver and gold and much military equipment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.27">But he refused to receive them, and he broke all the agreements he formerly had made with Simon, and became estranged from him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.28">He sent to him Athenobius, one of his friends, to confer with him, saying, "You hold control of Joppa and Gazara and the citadel in Jerusalem; they are cities of my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.29">You have devastated their territory, you have done great damage in the land, and you have taken possession of many places in my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.30">Now then, hand over the cities which you have seized and the tribute money of the places which you have conquered outside the borders of Judea;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.31">or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver, and for the destruction that you have caused and the tribute money of the cities, five hundred talents more. Otherwise we will come and conquer you."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.32">So Athenobius the friend of the king came to Jerusalem, and when he saw the splendor of Simon, and the sideboard with its gold and silver plate, and his great magnificence, he was amazed. He reported to him the words of the king,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.33">but Simon gave him this reply: "We have neither taken foreign land nor seized foreign property, but only the inheritance of our fathers, which at one time had been unjustly taken by our enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.34">Now that we have the opportunity, we are firmly holding the inheritance of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.35">As for Joppa and Gazara, which you demand, they were causing great damage among the people and to our land; for them we will give you a hundred talents." Athenobius did not answer him a word,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.36">but returned in wrath to the king and reported to him these words and the splendor of Simon and all that he had seen. And the king was greatly angered.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.37">Now Trypho embarked on a ship and escaped to Orthosia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.38">Then the king made Cendebeus commander-in-chief of the coastal country, and gave him troops of infantry and cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.39">He commanded him to encamp against Judea, and commanded him to build up Kedron and fortify its gates, and to make war on the people; but the king pursued Trypho.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.40">So Cendebeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the people and invade Judea and take the people captive and kill them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.15.41">He built up Kedron and stationed there horsemen and troops, so that they might go out and make raids along the highways of Judea, as the king had ordered him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Esd.16" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.1">John went up from Gazara and reported to Simon his father what Cendebeus had done.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.2">And Simon called in his two older sons Judas and John, and said to them: "I and my brothers and the house of my father have fought the wars of Israel from our youth until this day, and things have prospered in our hands so that we have delivered Israel many times.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.3">But now I have grown old, and you by His mercy are mature in years. Take my place and my brother's, and go out and fight for our nation, and may the help which comes from Heaven be with you."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.4">So John chose out of the country twenty thousand warriors and horsemen, and they marched against Cendebeus and camped for the night in Modein.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.5">Early in the morning they arose and marched into the plain, and behold, a large force of infantry and horsemen was coming to meet them; and a stream lay between them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.6">Then he and his army lined up against them. And he saw that the soldiers were afraid to cross the stream, so he crossed over first; and when his men saw him, they crossed over after him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.7">Then he divided the army and placed the horsemen in the midst of the infantry, for the cavalry of the enemy were very numerous.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.8">And they sounded the trumpets, and Cendebeus and his army were put to flight, and many of them were wounded and fell; the rest fled into the stronghold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.9">At that time Judas the brother of John was wounded, but John pursued them until Cendebeus reached Kedron, which he had built.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.10">They also fled into the towers that were in the fields of Azotus, and John burned it with fire, and about two thousand of them fell. And he returned to Judea safely.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.11">Now Ptolemy the son of Abubus had been appointed governor over the plain of Jericho, and he had much silver and gold,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.12">for he was son-in-law of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.13">His heart was lifted up; he determined to get control of the country, and made treacherous plans against Simon and his sons, to do away with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.14">Now Simon was visiting the cities of the country and attending to their needs, and he went down to Jericho with Mattathias and Judas his sons, in the one hundred and seventy-seventh year, in the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.15">The son of Abubus received them treacherously in the little stronghold called Dok, which he had built; he gave them a great banquet, and hid men there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.16">When Simon and his sons were drunk, Ptolemy and his men rose up, took their weapons, and rushed in against Simon in the banquet hall, and they killed him and his two sons and some of his servants.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.17">So he committed an act of great treachery and returned evil for good.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.18">Then Ptolemy wrote a report about these things and sent it to the king, asking him to send troops to aid him and to turn over to him the cities and the country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.19">He sent other men to Gazara to do away with John; he sent letters to the captains asking them to come to him so that he might give them silver and gold and gifts;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.20">and he sent other men to take possession of Jerusalem and the temple hill.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.21">But some one ran ahead and reported to John at Gazara that his father and brothers had perished, and that "he has sent men to kill you also."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.22">When he heard this, he was greatly shocked; and he seized the men who came to destroy him and killed them, for he had found out that they were seeking to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.23">The rest of the acts of John and his wars and the brave deeds which he did, and the building of the walls which he built, and his achievements,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Esd.16.24">behold, they are written in the chronicles of his high priesthood, from the time that he became high priest after his father.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Macc.1" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.1">After Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came from the land of Kittim, had defeated Darius, king of the Persians and the Medes, he succeeded him as king. (He had previously become king of Greece.)</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.2">He fought many battles, conquered strongholds, and put to death the kings of the earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.3">He advanced to the ends of the earth, and plundered many nations. When the earth became quiet before him, he was exalted, and his heart was lifted up.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.4">He gathered a very strong army and ruled over countries, nations, and princes, and they became tributary to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.5">After this he fell sick and perceived that he was dying.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.6">So he summoned his most honored officers, who had been brought up with him from youth, and divided his kingdom among them while he was still alive.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.7">And after Alexander had reigned twelve years, he died.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.8">Then his officers began to rule, each in his own place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.9">They all put on crowns after his death, and so did their sons after them for many years; and they caused many evils on the earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.10">From them came forth a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king; he had been a hostage in Rome. He began to reign in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.11">In those days lawless men came forth from Israel, and misled many, saying, "Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles round about us, for since we separated from them many evils have come upon us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.12">This proposal pleased them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.13">and some of the people eagerly went to the king. He authorized them to observe the ordinances of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.14">So they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, according to Gentile custom,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.15">and removed the marks of circumcision, and abandoned the holy covenant. They joined with the Gentiles and sold themselves to do evil.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.16">When Antiochus saw that his kingdom was established, he determined to become king of the land of Egypt, that he might reign over both kingdoms.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.17">So he invaded Egypt with a strong force, with chariots and elephants and cavalry and with a large fleet.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.18">He engaged Ptolemy king of Egypt in battle, and Ptolemy turned and fled before him, and many were wounded and fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.19">And they captured the fortified cities in the land of Egypt, and he plundered the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.20">After subduing Egypt, Antiochus returned in the one hundred and forty-third year. He went up against Israel and came to Jerusalem with a strong force.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.21">He arrogantly entered the sanctuary and took the golden altar, the lampstand for the light, and all its utensils.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.22">He took also the table for the bread of the Presence, the cups for drink offerings, the bowls, the golden censers, the curtain, the crowns, and the gold decoration on the front of the temple; he stripped it all off.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.23">He took the silver and the gold, and the costly vessels; he took also the hidden treasures which he found.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.24">Taking them all, he departed to his own land. He committed deeds of murder, and spoke with great arrogance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.25">Israel mourned deeply in every community,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.26">rulers and elders groaned, maidens and young men became faint, the beauty of women faded.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.27">Every bridegroom took up the lament; she who sat in the bridal chamber was mourning.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.28">Even the land shook for its inhabitants, and all the house of Jacob was clothed with shame.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.29">Two years later the king sent to the cities of Judah a chief collector of tribute, and he came to Jerusalem with a large force.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.30">Deceitfully he spoke peaceable words to them, and they believed him; but he suddenly fell upon the city, dealt it a severe blow, and destroyed many people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.31">He plundered the city, burned it with fire, and tore down its houses and its surrounding walls.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.32">And they took captive the women and children, and seized the cattle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.33">Then they fortified the city of David with a great strong wall and strong towers, and it became their citadel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.34">And they stationed there a sinful people, lawless men. These strengthened their position;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.35">they stored up arms and food, and collecting the spoils of Jerusalem they stored them there, and became a great snare.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.36">It became an ambush against the sanctuary, an evil adversary of Israel continually.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.37">On every side of the sanctuary they shed innocent blood; they even defiled the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.38">Because of them the residents of Jerusalem fled; she became a dwelling of strangers; she became strange to her offspring, and her children forsook her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.39">Her sanctuary became desolate as a desert; her feasts were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into a reproach, her honor into contempt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.40">Her dishonor now grew as great as her glory; her exaltation was turned into mourning.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.41">Then the king wrote to his whole kingdom that all should be one people,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.42">and that each should give up his customs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.43">All the Gentiles accepted the command of the king. Many even from Israel gladly adopted his religion; they sacrificed to idols and profaned the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.44">And the king sent letters by messengers to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah; he directed them to follow customs strange to the land,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.45">to forbid burnt offerings and sacrifices and drink offerings in the sanctuary, to profane sabbaths and feasts,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.46">to defile the sanctuary and the priests,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.47">to build altars and sacred precincts and shrines for idols, to sacrifice swine and unclean animals,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.48">and to leave their sons uncircumcised. They were to make themselves abominable by everything unclean and profane,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.49">so that they should forget the law and change all the ordinances.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.50">"And whoever does not obey the command of the king shall die."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.51">In such words he wrote to his whole kingdom. And he appointed inspectors over all the people and commanded the cities of Judah to offer sacrifice, city by city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.52">Many of the people, every one who forsook the law, joined them, and they did evil in the land;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.53">they drove Israel into hiding in every place of refuge they had.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.54">Now on the fifteenth day of Chislev, in the one hundred and forty-fifth year, they erected a desolating sacrilege upon the altar of burnt offering. They also built altars in the surrounding cities of Judah,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.55">and burned incense at the doors of the houses and in the streets.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.56">The books of the law which they found they tore to pieces and burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.57">Where the book of the covenant was found in the possession of any one, or if any one adhered to the law, the decree of the king condemned him to death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.58">They kept using violence against Israel, against those found month after month in the cities.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.59">And on the twenty-fifth day of the month they offered sacrifice on the altar which was upon the altar of burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.60">According to the decree, they put to death the women who had their children circumcised,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.61">and their families and those who circumcised them; and they hung the infants from their mothers' necks.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.62">But many in Israel stood firm and were resolved in their hearts not to eat unclean food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.63">They chose to die rather than to be defiled by food or to profane the holy covenant; and they did die.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.1.64">And very great wrath came upon Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Macc.2" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.1">In those days Mattathias the son of John, son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, moved from Jerusalem and settled in Modein.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.2">He had five sons, John surnamed Gaddi,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.3">Simon called Thassi,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.4">Judas called Maccabeus,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.5">Eleazar called Avaran, and Jonathan called Apphus.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.6">He saw the blasphemies being committed in Judah and Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.7">and said, "Alas! Why was I born to see this, the ruin of my people, the ruin of the holy city, and to dwell there when it was given over to the enemy, the sanctuary given over to aliens?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.8">Her temple has become like a man without honor;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.9">her glorious vessels have been carried into captivity. Her babes have been killed in her streets, her youths by the sword of the foe.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.10">What nation has not inherited her palaces and has not seized her spoils?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.11">All her adornment has been taken away; no longer free, she has become a slave.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.12">And behold, our holy place, our beauty, and our glory have been laid waste; the Gentiles have profaned it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.13">Why should we live any longer?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.14">And Mattathias and his sons rent their clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned greatly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.15">Then the king's officers who were enforcing the apostasy came to the city of Modein to make them offer sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.16">Many from Israel came to them; and Mattathias and his sons were assembled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.17">Then the king's officers spoke to Mattathias as follows: "You are a leader, honored and great in this city, and supported by sons and brothers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.18">Now be the first to come and do what the king commands, as all the Gentiles and the men of Judah and those that are left in Jerusalem have done. Then you and your sons will be numbered among the friends of the king, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.19">But Mattathias answered and said in a loud voice: "Even if all the nations that live under the rule of the king obey him, and have chosen to do his commandments, departing each one from the religion of his fathers,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.20">yet I and my sons and my brothers will live by the covenant of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.21">Far be it from us to desert the law and the ordinances.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.22">We will not obey the king's words by turning aside from our religion to the right hand or to the left."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.23">When he had finished speaking these words, a Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice upon the altar in Modein, according to the king's command.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.24">When Mattathias saw it, be burned with zeal and his heart was stirred. He gave vent to righteous anger; he ran and killed him upon the altar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.25">At the same time he killed the king's officer who was forcing them to sacrifice, and he tore down the altar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.26">Thus he burned with zeal for the law, as Phinehas did against Zimri the son of Salu.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.27">Then Mattathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying: "Let every one who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.28">And he and his sons fled to the hills and left all that they had in the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.29">Then many who were seeking righteousness and justice went down to the wilderness to dwell there,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.30">they, their sons, their wives, and their cattle, because evils pressed heavily upon them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.31">And it was reported to the king's officers, and to the troops in Jerusalem the city of David, that men who had rejected the king's command had gone down to the hiding places in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.32">Many pursued them, and overtook them; they encamped opposite them and prepared for battle against them on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.33">And they said to them, "Enough of this! Come out and do what the king commands, and you will live."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.34">But they said, "We will not come out, nor will we do what the king commands and so profane the sabbath day."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.35">Then the enemy hastened to attack them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.36">But they did not answer them or hurl a stone at them or block up their hiding places,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.37">for they said, "Let us all die in our innocence; heaven and earth testify for us that you are killing us unjustly."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.38">So they attacked them on the sabbath, and they died, with their wives and children and cattle, to the number of a thousand persons.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.39">When Mattathias and his friends learned of it, they mourned for them deeply.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.40">And each said to his neighbor: "If we all do as our brethren have done and refuse to fight with the Gentiles for our lives and for our ordinances, they will quickly destroy us from the earth."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.41">So they made this decision that day: "Let us fight against every man who comes to attack us on the sabbath day; let us not all die as our brethren died in their hiding places."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.42">Then there united with them a company of Hasideans, mighty warriors of Israel, every one who offered himself willingly for the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.43">And all who became fugitives to escape their troubles joined them and reinforced them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.44">They organized an army, and struck down sinners in their anger and lawless men in their wrath; the survivors fled to the Gentiles for safety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.45">And Mattathias and his friends went about and tore down the altars;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.46">they forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys that they found within the borders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.47">They hunted down the arrogant men, and the work prospered in their hands.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.48">They rescued the law out of the hands of the Gentiles and kings, and they never let the sinner gain the upper hand.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.49">Now the days drew near for Mattathias to die, and he said to his sons: "Arrogance and reproach have now become strong; it is a time of ruin and furious anger.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.50">Now, my children, show zeal for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.2.51">"Remember the deeds of the fathers, which they did in their generations; and receive great honor and an everlasting name.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.1">Then Judas his son, who was called Maccabeus, took command in his place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.2">All his brothers and all who had joined his father helped him; they gladly fought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.3">He extended the glory of his people. Like a giant he put on his breastplate; he girded on his armor of war and waged battles, protecting the host by his sword.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.4">He was like a lion in his deeds, like a lion's cub roaring for prey.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.5">He searched out and pursued the lawless; he burned those who troubled his people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.6">Lawless men shrank back for fear of him; all the evildoers were confounded; and deliverance prospered by his hand.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.7">He embittered many kings, but he made Jacob glad by his deeds, and his memory is blessed for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.8">He went through the cities of Judah; he destroyed the ungodly out of the land; thus he turned away wrath from Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.9">He was renowned to the ends of the earth; he gathered in those who were perishing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.10">But Apollonius gathered together Gentiles and a large force from Samaria to fight against Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.11">When Judas learned of it, he went out to meet him, and he defeated and killed him. Many were wounded and fell, and the rest fled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.12">Then they seized their spoils; and Judas took the sword of Apollonius, and used it in battle the rest of his life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.13">Now when Seron, the commander of the Syrian army, heard that Judas had gathered a large company, including a body of faithful men who stayed with him and went out to battle,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.14">he said, "I will make a name for myself and win honor in the kingdom. I will make war on Judas and his companions, who scorn the king's command."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.15">And again a strong army of ungodly men went up with him to help him, to take vengeance on the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.16">When he approached the ascent of Beth-horon, Judas went out to meet him with a small company.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.17">But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to Judas, "How can we, few as we are, fight against so great and strong a multitude? And we are faint, for we have eaten nothing today."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.18">Judas replied, "It is easy for many to be hemmed in by few, for in the sight of Heaven there is no difference between saving by many or by few.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.19">It is not on the size of the army that victory in battle depends, but strength comes from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.20">They come against us in great pride and lawlessness to destroy us and our wives and our children, and to despoil us;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.22">He himself will crush them before us; as for you, do not be afraid of them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.23">When he finished speaking, he rushed suddenly against Seron and his army, and they were crushed before him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.24">They pursued them down the descent of Beth-horon to the plain; eight hundred of them fell, and the rest fled into the land of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.25">Then Judas and his brothers began to be feared, and terror fell upon the Gentiles round about them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.26">His fame reached the king, and the Gentiles talked of the battles of Judas.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.27">When king Antiochus heard these reports, he was greatly angered; and he sent and gathered all the forces of his kingdom, a very strong army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.28">And he opened his coffers and gave a year's pay to his forces, and ordered them to be ready for any need.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.29">Then he saw that the money in the treasury was exhausted, and that the revenues from the country were small because of the dissension and disaster which he had caused in the land by abolishing the laws that had existed from the earliest days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.30">He feared that he might not have such funds as he had before for his expenses and for the gifts which he used to give more lavishly than preceding kings.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.31">He was greatly perplexed in mind, and determined to go to Persia and collect the revenues from those regions and raise a large fund.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.32">He left Lysias, a distinguished man of royal lineage, in charge of the king's affairs from the river Euphrates to the borders of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.33">Lysias was also to take care of Antiochus his son until he returned.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.34">And he turned over to Lysias half of his troops and the elephants, and gave him orders about all that he wanted done. As for the residents of Judea and Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.35">Lysias was to send a force against them to wipe out and destroy the strength of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem; he was to banish the memory of them from the place,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.36">settle aliens in all their territory, and distribute their land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.37">Then the king took the remaining half of his troops and departed from Antioch his capital in the one hundred and forty-seventh year. He crossed the Euphrates river and went through the upper provinces.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.38">Lysias chose Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor and Gorgias, mighty men among the friends of the king,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.39">and sent with them forty thousand infantry and seven thousand cavalry to go into the land of Judah and destroy it, as the king had commanded.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.40">so they departed with their entire force, and when they arrived they encamped near Emmaus in the plain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.41">When the traders of the region heard what was said to them, they took silver and gold in immense amounts, and fetters, and went to the camp to get the sons of Israel for slaves. And forces from Syria and the land of the Philistines joined with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.42">Now Judas and his brothers saw that misfortunes had increased and that the forces were encamped in their territory. They also learned what the king had commanded to do to the people to cause their final destruction.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.43">But they said to one another, "Let us repair the destruction of our people, and fight for our people and the sanctuary."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.44">And the congregation assembled to be ready for battle, and to pray and ask for mercy and compassion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.45">Jerusalem was uninhabited like a wilderness; not one of her children went in or out.The sanctuary was trampled own, and the sons of aliens held the citadel; it was a lodging place for the Gentiles. Joy was taken from Jacob; the flute and the harp ceased to play.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.46">So they assembled and went to Mizpah, opposite Jerusalem, because Israel formerly had a place of prayer in Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.47">They fasted that day, put on sackcloth and sprinkled ashes on their heads, and rent their clothes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.48">And they opened the book of the law to inquire into those matters about which the Gentiles were consulting the images of their idols.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.49">They also brought the garments of the priesthood and the first fruits and the tithes, and they stirred up the Nazirites who had completed their days;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.50">and they cried aloud to Heaven, saying, "What shall we do with these? Where shall we take them?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.51">Thy sanctuary is trampled down and profaned, and thy priests mourn in humiliation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.52">And behold, the Gentiles are assembled against us to destroy us; thou knowest what they plot against us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.53">How will we be able to withstand them, if thou dost not help us?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.54">Then they sounded the trumpets and gave a loud shout.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.55">After this Judas appointed leaders of the people, in charge of thousands and hundreds and fifties and tens.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.56">And he said to those who were building houses, or were betrothed, or were planting vineyards, or were fainthearted, that each should return to his home, according to the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.57">Then the army marched out and encamped to the south of Emmaus.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.58">And Judas said, "Gird yourselves and be valiant. Be ready early in the morning to fight with these Gentiles who have assembled against us to destroy us and our sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.59">It is better for us to die in battle than to see the misfortunes of our nation and of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.3.60">But as his will in heaven may be, so he will do."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Macc.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.1">Now Gorgias took five thousand infantry and a thousand picked cavalry, and this division moved out by night</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.2">to fall upon the camp of the Jews and attack them suddenly. Men from the citadel were his guides.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.3">But Judas heard of it, and he and his mighty men moved out to attack the king's force in Emmaus</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.4">while the division was still absent from the camp.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.5">When Gorgias entered the camp of Judas by night, he found no one there, so he looked for them in the hills, because he said, "These men are fleeing from us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.6">At daybreak Judas appeared in the plain with three thousand men, but they did not have armor and swords such as they desired.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.[7]">And they saw the camp of the Gentiles, strong and fortified, with cavalry round about it; and these men were trained in war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.8">But Judas said to the men who were with him, "Do not fear their numbers or be afraid when they charge.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.9">Remember how our fathers were saved at the Red Sea, when Pharaoh with his forces pursued them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.10">And now let us cry to Heaven, to see whether he will favor us and remember his covenant with our fathers and crush this army before us today.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.11">Then all the Gentiles will know that there is one who redeems and saves Israel."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.12">When the foreigners looked up and saw them coming against them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.13">they went forth from their camp to battle. Then the men with Judas blew their trumpets</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.14">and engaged in battle. The Gentiles were crushed and fled into the plain,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.15">and all those in the rear fell by the sword. They pursued them to Gazara, and to the plains of Idumea, and to Azotus and Jamnia; and three thousand of them fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.16">Then Judas and his force turned back from pursuing them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.17">and he said to the people, "Do not be greedy for plunder, for there is a battle before us;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.18">Gorgias and his force are near us in the hills. But stand now against our enemies and fight them, and afterward seize the plunder boldly."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.19">Just as Judas was finishing this speech, a detachment appeared, coming out of the hills.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.20">They saw that their army had been put to flight, and that the Jews were burning the camp, for the smoke that was seen showed what had happened.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.21">When they perceived this they were greatly frightened, and when they also saw the army of Judas drawn up in the plain for battle,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.22">they all fled into the land of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.23">Then Judas returned to plunder the camp, and they seized much gold and silver, and cloth dyed blue and sea purple, and great riches.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.24">On their return they sang hymns and praises to Heaven, for he is good, for his mercy endures for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.25">Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.26">Those of the foreigners who escaped went and reported to Lysias all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.27">When he heard it, he was perplexed and discouraged, for things had not happened to Israel as he had intended, nor had they turned out as the king had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.28">But the next year he mustered sixty thousand picked infantrymen and five thousand cavalry to subdue them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.29">They came into Idumea and encamped at Beth-zur, and Judas met them with ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.30">When he saw that the army was strong, he prayed, saying, "Blessed art thou, O Savior of Israel, who didst crush the attack of the mighty warrior by the hand of thy servant David, and didst give the camp of the Philistines into the hands of Jonathan, the son of Saul, and of the man who carried his armor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.31">So do thou hem in this army by the hand of thy people Israel, and let them be ashamed of their troops and their cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.32">Fill them with cowardice; melt the boldness of their strength; let them tremble in their destruction.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.33">Strike them down with the sword of those who love thee, and let all who know thy name praise thee with hymns."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.34">Then both sides attacked, and there fell of the army of Lysias five thousand men; they fell in action.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.35">And when Lysias saw the rout of his troops and observed the boldness which inspired those of Judas, and how ready they were either to live or to die nobly, he departed to Antioch and enlisted mercenaries, to invade Judea again with an even larger army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.36">Then said Judas and his brothers, "Behold, our enemies are crushed; let us go up to cleanse the sanctuary and dedicate it."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.37">So all the army assembled and they went up to Mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.38">And they saw the sanctuary desolate, the altar profaned, and the gates burned. In the courts they saw bushes sprung up as in a thicket, or as on one of the mountains. They saw also the chambers of the priests in ruins.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.39">Then they rent their clothes, and mourned with great lamentation, and sprinkled themselves with ashes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.40">They fell face down on the ground, and sounded the signal on the trumpets, and cried out to Heaven.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.41">Then Judas detailed men to fight against those in the citadel until he had cleansed the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.42">He chose blameless priests devoted to the law,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.43">and they cleansed the sanctuary and removed the defiled stones to an unclean place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.44">They deliberated what to do about the altar of burnt offering, which had been profaned.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.45">And they thought it best to tear it down, lest it bring reproach upon them, for the Gentiles had defiled it. So they tore down the altar,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.46">and stored the stones in a convenient place on the temple hill until there should come a prophet to tell what to do with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.47">Then they took unhewn stones, as the law directs, and built a new altar like the former one.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.48">They also rebuilt the sanctuary and the interior of the temple, and consecrated the courts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.49">They made new holy vessels, and brought the lampstand, the altar of incense, and the table into the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.50">Then they burned incense on the altar and lighted the lamps on the lampstand, and these gave light in the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.51">They placed the bread on the table and hung up the curtains. Thus they finished all the work they had undertaken.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.52">Early in the morning on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, which is the month of Chislev, in the one hundred and forty-eighth year,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.53">they rose and offered sacrifice, as the law directs, on the new altar of burnt offering which they had built.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.54">At the very season and on the very day that the Gentiles had profaned it, it was dedicated with songs and harps and lutes and cymbals.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.55">All the people fell on their faces and worshiped and blessed Heaven, who had prospered them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.56">So they celebrated the dedication of the altar for eight days, and offered burnt offerings with gladness; they offered a sacrifice of deliverance and praise.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.57">They decorated the front of the temple with golden crowns and small shields; they restored the gates and the chambers for the priests, and furnished them with doors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.58">There was very great gladness among the people, and the reproach of the Gentiles was removed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.59">Then Judas and his brothers and all the assembly of Israel determined that every year at that season the days of dedication of the altar should be observed with gladness and joy for eight days, beginning with the twenty-fifth day of the month of Chislev.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.60">At that time they fortified Mount Zion with high walls and strong towers round about, to keep the Gentiles from coming and trampling them down as they had done before.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.4.61">And he stationed a garrison there to hold it. He also fortified Beth-zur, so that the people might have a stronghold that faced Idumea.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.1">When the Gentiles round about heard that the altar had been built and the sanctuary dedicated as it was before, they became very angry,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.3">But Judas made war on the sons of Esau in Idumea, at Akrabattene, because they kept lying in wait for Israel. He dealt them a heavy blow and humbled them and despoiled them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.4">He also remembered the wickedness of the sons of Baean, who were a trap and a snare to the people and ambushed them on the highways.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.8">He also took Jazer and its villages; then he returned to Judea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.9">Now the Gentiles in Gilead gathered together against the Israelites who lived in their territory, and planned to destroy them. But they fled to the stronghold of Dathema,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.10">and sent to Judas and his brothers a letter which said, "The Gentiles around us have gathered together against us to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.11">They are preparing to come and capture the stronghold to which we have fled, and Timothy is leading their forces.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.12">Now then come and rescue us from their hands, for many of us have fallen,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.13">and all our brethren who were in the land of Tob have been killed; the enemy have captured their wives and children and goods, and have destroyed about a thousand men there."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.14">While the letter was still being read, behold, other messengers, with their garments rent, came from Galilee and made a similar report;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.15">they said that against them had gathered together men of Ptolemais and Tyre and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, "to annihilate us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.16">When Judas and the people heard these messages, a great assembly was called to determine what they should do for their brethren who were in distress and were being attacked by enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.17">Then Judas said to Simon his brother, "Choose your men and go and rescue your brethren in Galilee; I and Jonathan my brother will go to Gilead."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.18">But he left Joseph, the son of Zechariah, and Azariah, a leader of the people, with the rest of the forces, in Judea to guard it;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.19">and he gave them this command, "Take charge of this people, but do not engage in battle with the Gentiles until we return."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.20">Then three thousand men were assigned to Simon to go to Galilee, and eight thousand to Judas for Gilead.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.21">so Simon went to Galilee and fought many battles against the Gentiles, and the Gentiles were crushed before him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.22">He pursued them to the gate of Ptolemais, and as many as three thousand of the Gentiles fell, and he despoiled them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.23">Then he took the Jews of Galilee and Arbatta, with their wives and children, and all they possessed, and led them to Judea with great rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.24">Judas Maccabeus and Jonathan his brother crossed the Jordan and went three days' journey into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.25">They encountered the Nabateans, who met them peaceably and told them all that had happened to their brethren in Gilead:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.26">"Many of them have been shut up in Bozrah and Bosor, in Alema and Chaspho, Maked and Carnaim" -- all these cities were strong and large--</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.27">"and some have been shut up in the other cities of Gilead; the enemy are getting ready to attack the strongholds tomorrow and take and destroy all these men in one day."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.28">Then Judas and his army quickly turned back by the wilderness road to Bozrah; and he took the city, and killed every male by the edge of the sword; then he seized all its spoils and burned it with fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.29">He departed from there at night, and they went all the way to the stronghold of Dathema.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.30">At dawn they looked up, and behold, a large company, that could not be counted, carrying ladders and engines of war to capture the stronghold, and attacking the Jews within.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.31">So Judas saw that the battle had begun and that the cry of the city went up to Heaven with trumpets and loud shouts,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.32">and he said to the men of his forces, "Fight today for your brethren!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.33">Then he came up behind them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets and cried aloud in prayer.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.34">And when the army of Timothy realized that it was Maccabeus, they fled before him, and he dealt them a heavy blow. As many as eight thousand of them fell that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.35">Next he turned aside to Alema, and fought against it and took it; and he killed every male in it, plundered it, and burned it with fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.36">From there he marched on and took Chaspho, Maked, and Bosor, and the other cities of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.37">After these things Timothy gathered another army and encamped opposite Raphon, on the other side of the stream.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.38">Judas sent men to spy out the camp, and they reported to him, "All the Gentiles around us have gathered to him; it is a very large force.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.39">They also have hired Arabs to help them, and they are encamped across the stream, ready to come and fight against you." And Judas went to meet them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.40">Now as Judas and his army drew near to the stream of water, Timothy said to the officers of his forces, "If he crosses over to us first, we will not be able to resist him, for he will surely defeat us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.41">But if he shows fear and camps on the other side of the river, we will cross over to him and defeat him."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.42">When Judas approached the stream of water, he stationed the scribes of the people at the stream and gave them this command, "Permit no man to encamp, but make them all enter the battle."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.43">Then he crossed over against them first, and the whole army followed him. All the Gentiles were defeated before him, and they threw away their arms and fled into the sacred precincts at Carnaim.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.44">But he took the city and burned the sacred precincts with fire, together with all who were in them. Thus Carnaim was conquered; they could stand before Judas no longer.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.45">Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites in Gilead, the small and the great, with their wives and children and goods, a very large company, to go to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.46">So they came to Ephron. This was a large and very strong city on the road, and they could not go round it to the right or to the left; they had to go through it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.47">But the men of the city shut them out and blocked up the gates with stones.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.48">And Judas sent them this friendly message, "Let us pass through your land to get to our land. No one will do you harm; we will simply pass by on foot." But they refused to open to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.49">Then Judas ordered proclamation to be made to the army that each should encamp where he was.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.50">So the men of the forces encamped, and he fought against the city all that day and all the night, and the city was delivered into his hands.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.51">He destroyed every male by the edge of the sword, and razed and plundered the city. Then he passed through the city over the slain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.52">And they crossed the Jordan into the large plain before Beth-shan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.53">And Judas kept rallying the laggards and encouraging the people all the way till he came to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.54">So they went up to Mount Zion with gladness and joy, and offered burnt offerings, because not one of them had fallen before they returned in safety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.55">Now while Judas and Jonathan were in Gilead and Simon his brother was in Galilee before Ptolemais,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.56">Joseph, the son of Zechariah, and Azariah, the commanders of the forces, heard of their brave deeds and of the heroic war they had fought.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.57">So they said, "Let us also make a name for ourselves; let us go and make war on the Gentiles around us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.58">And they issued orders to the men of the forces that were with them, and they marched against Jamnia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.59">And Gorgias and his men came out of the city to meet them in battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.60">Then Joseph and Azariah were routed, and were pursued to the borders of Judea; as many as two thousand of the people of Israel fell that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.61">Thus the people suffered a great rout because, thinking to do a brave deed, they did not listen to Judas and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.62">But they did not belong to the family of those men through whom deliverance was given to Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.63">The man Judas and his brothers were greatly honored in all Israel and among all the Gentiles, wherever their name was heard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.64">Men gathered to them and praised them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.65">Then Judas and his brothers went forth and fought the sons of Esau in the land to the south. He struck Hebron and its villages and tore down its strongholds and burned its towers round about.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.66">Then he marched off to go into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Marisa.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.67">On that day some priests, who wished to do a brave deed, fell in battle, for they went out to battle unwisely.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.5.68">But Judas turned aside to Azotus in the land of the Philistines; he tore down their altars, and the graven images of their gods he burned with fire; he plundered the cities and returned to the land of Judah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Macc.6" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.1">King Antiochus was going through the upper provinces when he heard that Elymais in Persia was a city famed for its wealth in silver and gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.2">Its temple was very rich, containing golden shields, breastplates, and weapons left there by Alexander, the son of Philip, the Macedonian king who first reigned over the Greeks.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.3">So he came and tried to take the city and plunder it, but he could not, because his plan became known to the men of the city</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.4">and they withstood him in battle. So he fled and in great grief departed from there to return to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.5">Then some one came to him in Persia and reported that the armies which had gone into the land of Judah had been routed;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.6">that Lysias had gone first with a strong force, but had turned and fled before the Jews; that the Jews had grown strong from the arms, supplies, and abundant spoils which they had taken from the armies they had cut down;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.7">that they had torn down the abomination which he had erected upon the altar in Jerusalem; and that they had surrounded the sanctuary with high walls as before, and also Beth-zur, his city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.8">When the king heard this news, he was astounded and badly shaken. He took to his bed and became sick from grief, because things had not turned out for him as he had planned.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.9">He lay there for many days, because deep grief continually gripped him, and he concluded that he was dying.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.10">So he called all his friends and said to them, "Sleep departs from my eyes and I am downhearted with worry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.11">I said to myself, `To what distress I have come! And into what a great flood I now am plunged! For I was kind and beloved in my power.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.12">But now I remember the evils I did in Jerusalem. I seized all her vessels of silver and gold; and I sent to destroy the inhabitants of Judah without good reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.13">I know that it is because of this that these evils have come upon me; and behold, I am perishing of deep grief in a strange land."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.14">Then he called for Philip, one of his friends, and made him ruler over all his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.15">He gave him the crown and his robe and the signet, that he might guide Antiochus his son and bring him up to be king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.16">Thus Antiochus the king died there in the one hundred and forty-ninth year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.17">And when Lysias learned that the king was dead, he set up Antiochus the king's son to reign. Lysias had brought him up as a boy, and he named him Eupator.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.18">Now the men in the citadel kept hemming Israel in around the sanctuary. They were trying in every way to harm them and strengthen the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.19">So Judas decided to destroy them, and assembled all the people to besiege them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.20">They gathered together and besieged the citadel in the one hundred and fiftieth year; and he built siege towers and other engines of war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.21">But some of the garrison escaped from the siege and some of the ungodly Israelites joined them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.22">They went to the king and said, "How long will you fail to do justice and to avenge our brethren?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.23">We were happy to serve your father, to live by what he said and to follow his commands.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.24">For this reason the sons of our people besieged the citadel and became hostile to us; moreover, they have put to death as many of us as they have caught, and they have seized our inheritances.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.25">And not against us alone have they stretched out their hands, but also against all the lands on their borders.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.26">And behold, today they have encamped against the citadel in Jerusalem to take it; they have fortified both the sanctuary and Beth-zur;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.27">and unless you quickly prevent them, they will do still greater things, and you will not be able to stop them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.28">The king was enraged when he heard this. He assembled all his friends, the commanders of his forces and those in authority.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.29">And mercenary forces came to him from other kingdoms and from islands of the seas.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.30">The number of his forces was a hundred thousand foot soldiers, twenty thousand horsemen, and thirty-two elephants accustomed to war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.31">They came through Idumea and encamped against Beth-zur, and for many days they fought and built engines of war; but the Jews sallied out and burned these with fire, and fought manfully.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.32">Then Judas marched away from the citadel and encamped at Beth-zechariah, opposite the camp of the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.33">Early in the morning the king rose and took his army by a forced march along the road to Beth-zechariah, and his troops made ready for battle and sounded their trumpets.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.34">They showed the elephants the juice of grapes and mulberries, to arouse them for battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.35">And they distributed the beasts among the phalanxes; with each elephant they stationed a thousand men armed with coats of mail, and with brass helmets on their heads; and five hundred picked horsemen were assigned to each beast.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.36">These took their position beforehand wherever the beast was; wherever it went they went with it, and they never left it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.37">And upon the elephants were wooden towers, strong and covered; they were fastened upon each beast by special harness, and upon each were four armed men who fought from there, and also its Indian driver.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.38">The rest of the horsemen were stationed on either side, on the two flanks of the army, to harass the enemy while being themselves protected by the phalanxes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.39">When the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the hills were ablaze with them and gleamed like flaming torches.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.40">Now a part of the king's army was spread out on the high hills, and some troops were on the plain, and they advanced steadily and in good order.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.41">All who heard the noise made by their multitude, by the marching of the multitude and the clanking of their arms, trembled, for the army was very large and strong.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.42">But Judas and his army advanced to the battle, and six hundred men of the king's army fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.43">And Eleazar, called Avaran, saw that one of the beasts was equipped with royal armor. It was taller than all the others, and he supposed that the king was upon it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.44">So he gave his life to save his people and to win for himself an everlasting name.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.45">He courageously ran into the midst of the phalanx to reach it; he killed men right and left, and they parted before him on both sides.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.46">He got under the elephant, stabbed it from beneath, and killed it; but it fell to the ground upon him and he died.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.47">And when the Jews saw the royal might and the fierce attack of the forces, they turned away in flight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.48">The soldiers of the king's army went up to Jerusalem against them, and the king encamped in Judea and at Mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.49">He made peace with the men of Beth-zur, and they evacuated the city, because they had no provisions there to withstand a siege, since it was a sabbatical year for the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.50">So the king took Beth-zur and stationed a guard there to hold it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.51">Then he encamped before the sanctuary for many days. He set up siege towers, engines of war to throw fire and stones, machines to shoot arrows, and catapults.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.52">The Jews also made engines of war to match theirs, and fought for many days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.53">But they had no food in storage, because it was the seventh year; those who found safety in Judea from the Gentiles had consumed the last of the stores.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.54">Few men were left in the sanctuary, because famine had prevailed over the rest and they had been scattered, each to his own place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.55">Then Lysias heard that Philip, whom King Antiochus while still living had appointed to bring up Antiochus his son to be king,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.56">had returned from Persia and Media with the forces that had gone with the king, and that he was trying to seize control of the government.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.57">So he quickly gave orders to depart, and said to the king, to the commanders of the forces, and to the men, "We daily grow weaker, our food supply is scant, the place against which we are fighting is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom press urgently upon us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.58">Now then let us come to terms with these men, and make peace with them and with all their nation,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.59">and agree to let them live by their laws as they did before; for it was on account of their laws which we abolished that they became angry and did all these things."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.60">The speech pleased the king and the commanders, and he sent to the Jews an offer of peace, and they accepted it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.61">So the king and the commanders gave them their oath. On these conditions the Jews evacuated the stronghold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.62">But when the king entered Mount Zion and saw what a strong fortress the place was, he broke the oath he had sworn and gave orders to tear down the wall all around.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.6.63">Then he departed with haste and returned to Antioch. He found Philip in control of the city, but he fought against him, and took the city by force.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Macc.7" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.1">In the one hundred and fifty-first year Demetrius the son of Seleucus set forth from Rome, sailed with a few men to a city by the sea, and there began to reign.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.2">As he was entering the royal palace of his fathers, the army seized Antiochus and Lysias to bring them to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.3">But when this act became known to him, he said, "Do not let me see their faces!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.4">So the army killed them, and Demetrius took his seat upon the throne of his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.5">Then there came to him all the lawless and ungodly men of Israel; they were led by Alcimus, who wanted to be high priest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.6">And they brought to the king this accusation against the people: "Judas and his brothers have destroyed all your friends, and have driven us out of our land.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.8">So the king chose Bacchides, one of the king's friends, governor of the province Beyond the River; he was a great man in the kingdom and was faithful to the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.9">And he sent him, and with him the ungodly Alcimus, whom he made high priest; and he commanded him to take vengeance on the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.10">So they marched away and came with a large force into the land of Judah; and he sent messengers to Judas and his brothers with peaceable but treacherous words.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.11">But they paid no attention to their words, for they saw that they had come with a large force.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.12">Then a group of scribes appeared in a body before Alcimus and Bacchides to ask for just terms.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.13">The Hasideans were first among the sons of Israel to seek peace from them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.14">for they said, "A priest of the line of Aaron has come with the army, and he will not harm us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.15">And he spoke peaceable words to them and swore this oath to them, "We will not seek to injure you or your friends."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.16">So they trusted him; but he seized sixty of them and killed them in one day, in accordance with the word which was written,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.17">"The flesh of thy saints and their blood they poured out round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.18">Then the fear and dread of them fell upon all the people, for they said, "There is no truth or justice in them, for they have violated the agreement and the oath which they swore."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.19">Then Bacchides departed from Jerusalem and encamped in Beth-zaith. And he sent and seized many of the men who had deserted to him, and some of the people, and killed them and threw them into a great pit.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.20">He placed Alcimus in charge of the country and left with him a force to help him; then Bacchides went back to the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.21">Alcimus strove for the high priesthood,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.22">and all who were troubling their people joined him. They gained control of the land of Judah and did great damage in Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.23">And Judas saw all the evil that Alcimus and those with him had done among the sons of Israel; it was more than the Gentiles had done.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.24">So Judas went out into all the surrounding parts of Judea, and took vengeance on the men who had deserted, and he prevented those in the city from going out into the country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.25">When Alcimus saw that Judas and those with him had grown strong, and realized that he could not withstand them, he returned to the king and brought wicked charges against them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.26">Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honored princes, who hated and detested Israel, and he commanded him to destroy the people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.27">So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a large force, and treacherously sent to Judas and his brothers this peaceable message,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.28">"Let there be no fighting between me and you; I shall come with a few men to see you face to face in peace."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.29">So he came to Judas, and they greeted one another peaceably. But the enemy were ready to seize Judas.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.30">It became known to Judas that Nicanor had come to him with treacherous intent, and he was afraid of him and would not meet him again.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.31">When Nicanor learned that his plan had been disclosed, he went out to meet Judas in battle near Caphar-salama.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.32">About five hundred men of the army of Nicanor fell, and the rest fled into the city of David.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.33">After these events Nicanor went up to Mount Zion. Some of the priests came out of the sanctuary, and some of the elders of the people, to greet him peaceably and to show him the burnt offering that was being offered for the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.34">But he mocked them and derided them and defiled them and spoke arrogantly,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.35">and in anger he swore this oath, "Unless Judas and his army are delivered into my hands this time, then if I return safely I will burn up this house." And he went out in great anger.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.36">Then the priests went in and stood before the altar and the temple, and they wept and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.37">"Thou didst choose this house to be called by thy name, and to be for thy people a house of prayer and supplication.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.38">Take vengeance on this man and on his army, and let them fall by the sword; remember their blasphemies, and let them live no longer."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.39">Now Nicanor went out from Jerusalem and encamped in Beth-horon, and the Syrian army joined him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.40">And Judas encamped in Adasa with three thousand men. Then Judas prayed and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.41">"When the messengers from the king spoke blasphemy, thy angel went forth and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand of the Assyrians.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.42">So also crush this army before us today; let the rest learn that Nicanor has spoken wickedly against the sanctuary, and judge him according to this wickedness."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.43">So the armies met in battle on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. The army of Nicanor was crushed, and he himself was the first to fall in the battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.44">When his army saw that Nicanor had fallen, they threw down their arms and fled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.45">The Jews pursued them a day's journey, from Adasa as far as Gazara, and as they followed kept sounding the battle call on the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.46">And men came out of all the villages of Judea round about, and they out-flanked the enemy and drove them back to their pursuers, so that they all fell by the sword; not even one of them was left.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.47">Then the Jews seized the spoils and the plunder, and they cut off Nicanor's head and the right hand which he so arrogantly stretched out, and brought them and displayed them just outside Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.48">The people rejoiced greatly and celebrated that day as a day of great gladness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.49">And they decreed that this day should be celebrated each year on the thirteenth day of Adar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.7.50">So the land of Judah had rest for a few days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Macc.8" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.1">Now Judas heard of the fame of the Romans, that they were very strong and were well-disposed toward all who made an alliance with them, that they pledged friendship to those who came to them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.2">and that they were very strong. Men told him of their wars and of the brave deeds which they were doing among the Gauls, how they had defeated them and forced them to pay tribute,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.3">and what they had done in the land of Spain to get control of the silver and gold mines there,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.4">and how they had gained control of the whole region by their planning and patience, even though the place was far distant from them. They also subdued the kings who came against them from the ends of the earth, until they crushed them and inflicted great disaster upon them; the rest paid them tribute every year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.5">Philip, and Perseus king of the Macedonians, and the others who rose up against them, they crushed in battle and conquered.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.6">They also defeated Antiochus the Great, king of Asia, who went to fight against them with a hundred and twenty elephants and with cavalry and chariots and a very large army. He was crushed by them;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.7">they took him alive and decreed that he and those who should reign after him should pay a heavy tribute and give hostages and surrender some of their best provinces,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.8">the country of India and Media and Lydia. These they took from him and gave to Eumenes the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.9">The Greeks planned to come and destroy them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.10">but this became known to them, and they sent a general against the Greeks and attacked them. Many of them were wounded and fell, and the Romans took captive their wives and children; they plundered them, conquered the land, tore down their strongholds, and enslaved them to this day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.11">The remaining kingdoms and islands, as many as ever opposed them, they destroyed and enslaved;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.12">but with their friends and those who rely on them they have kept friendship. They have subdued kings far and near, and as many as have heard of their fame have feared them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.13">Those whom they wish to help and to make kings, they make kings, and those whom they wish they depose; and they have been greatly exalted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.14">Yet for all this not one of them has put on a crown or worn purple as a mark of pride,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.15">but they have built for themselves a senate chamber, and every day three hundred and twenty senators constantly deliberate concerning the people, to govern them well.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.16">They trust one man each year to rule over them and to control all their land; they all heed the one man, and there is no envy or jealousy among them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.17">So Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome to establish friendship and alliance,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.18">and to free themselves from the yoke; for they saw that the kingdom of the Greeks was completely enslaving Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.19">They went to Rome, a very long journey; and they entered the senate chamber and spoke as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.20">"Judas, who is also called Maccabeus, and his brothers and the people of the Jews have sent us to you to establish alliance and peace with you, that we may be enrolled as your allies and friends."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.21">The proposal pleased them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.22">and this is a copy of the letter which they wrote in reply, on bronze tablets, and sent to Jerusalem to remain with them there as a memorial of peace and alliance:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.23">"May all go well with the Romans and with the nation of the Jews at sea and on land for ever, and may sword and enemy be far from them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.24">If war comes first to Rome or to any of their allies in all their dominion,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.25">the nation of the Jews shall act as their allies wholeheartedly, as the occasion may indicate to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.26">And to the enemy who makes war they shall not give or supply grain, arms, money, or ships, as Rome has decided; and they shall keep their obligations without receiving any return.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.27">In the same way, if war comes first to the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall willingly act as their allies, as the occasion may indicate to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.28">And to the enemy allies shall be given no grain, arms, money, or ships, as Rome has decided; and they shall keep these obligations and do so without deceit.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.29">Thus on these terms the Romans make a treaty with the Jewish people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.30">If after these terms are in effect both parties shall determine to add or delete anything, they shall do so at their discretion, and any addition or deletion that they may make shall be valid.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.31">"And concerning the wrongs which King Demetrius is doing to them we have written to him as follows, `Why have you made your yoke heavy upon our friends and allies the Jews?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.8.32">If now they appeal again for help against you, we will defend their rights and fight you on sea and on land.'"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Macc.9" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.1">When Demetrius heard that Nicanor and his army had fallen in battle, he sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judah a second time, and with them the right wing of the army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.2">They went by the road which leads to Gilgal and encamped against Mesaloth in Arbela, and they took it and killed many people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.3">In the first month of the one hundred and fifty-second year they encamped against Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.4">then they marched off and went to Berea with twenty thousand foot soldiers and two thousand cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.5">Now Judas was encamped in Elasa, and with him were three thousand picked men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.6">When they saw the huge number of the enemy forces, they were greatly frightened, and many slipped away from the camp, until no more than eight hundred of them were left.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.7">When Judas saw that his army had slipped away and the battle was imminent, he was crushed in spirit, for he had no time to assemble them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.8">He became faint, but he said to those who were left, "Let us rise and go up against our enemies. We may be able to fight them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.9">But they tried to dissuade him, saying, "We are not able. Let us rather save our own lives now, and let us come back with our brethren and fight them; we are too few."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.10">But Judas said, "Far be it from us to do such a thing as to flee from them. If our time has come, let us die bravely for our brethren, and leave no cause to question our honor."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.11">Then the army of Bacchides marched out from the camp and took its stand for the encounter. The cavalry was divided into two companies, and the slingers and the archers went ahead of the army, as did all the chief warriors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.12">Bacchides was on the right wing. Flanked by the two companies, the phalanx advanced to the sound of the trumpets; and the men with Judas also blew their trumpets.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.13">The earth was shaken by the noise of the armies, and the battle raged from morning till evening.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.14">Judas saw that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right; then all the stouthearted men went with him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.15">and they crushed the right wing, and he pursued them as far as Mount Azotus.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.16">When those on the left wing saw that the right wing was crushed, they turned and followed close behind Judas and his men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.17">The battle became desperate, and many on both sides were wounded and fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.18">Judas also fell, and the rest fled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.19">Then Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother and buried him in the tomb of their fathers at Modein,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.20">and wept for him. And all Israel made great lamentation for him; they mourned many days and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.21">"How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.22">Now the rest of the acts of Judas, and his wars and the brave deeds that he did, and his greatness, have not been recorded, for they were very many.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.23">After the death of Judas, the lawless emerged in all parts of Israel; all the doers of injustice appeared.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.24">In those days a very great famine occurred, and the country deserted with them to the enemy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.25">And Bacchides chose the ungodly and put them in charge of the country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.26">They sought and searched for the friends of Judas, and brought them to Bacchides, and he took vengeance on them and made sport of them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.27">Thus there was great distress in Israel, such as had not been since the time that prophets ceased to appear among them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.28">Then all the friends of Judas assembled and said to Jonathan,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.29">"Since the death of your brother Judas there has been no one like him to go against our enemies and Bacchides, and to deal with those of our nation who hate us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.30">So now we have chosen you today to take his place as our ruler and leader, to fight our battle."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.31">And Jonathan at that time accepted the leadership and took the place of Judas his brother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.32">When Bacchides learned of this, he tried to kill him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.33">But Jonathan and Simon his brother and all who were with him heard of it, and they fled into the wilderness of Tekoa and camped by the water of the pool of Asphar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.34">Bacchides found this out on the sabbath day, and he with all his army crossed the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.35">And Jonathan sent his brother as leader of the multitude and begged the Nabateans, who were his friends, for permission to store with them the great amount of baggage which they had.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.36">But the sons of Jambri from Medeba came out and seized John and all that he had, and departed with it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.37">After these things it was reported to Jonathan and Simon his brother, "The sons of Jambri are celebrating a great wedding, and are conducting the bride, a daughter of one of the great nobles of Canaan, from Nadabath with a large escort."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.38">And they remembered the blood of John their brother, and went up and hid under cover of the mountain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.39">They raised their eyes and looked, and saw a tumultuous procession with much baggage; and the bridegroom came out with his friends and his brothers to meet them with tambourines and musicians and many weapons.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.40">Then they rushed upon them from the ambush and began killing them. Many were wounded and fell, and the rest fled to the mountain; and they took all their goods.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.41">Thus the wedding was turned into mourning and the voice of their musicians into a funeral dirge.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.42">And when they had fully avenged the blood of their brother, they returned to the marshes of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.43">When Bacchides heard of this, he came with a large force on the sabbath day to the banks of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.44">And Jonathan said to those with him, "Let us rise up now and fight for our lives, for today things are not as they were before.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.45">For look! the battle is in front of us and behind us; the water of the Jordan is on this side and on that, with marsh and thicket; there is no place to turn.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.46">Cry out now to Heaven that you may be delivered from the hands of our enemies."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.47">So the battle began, and Jonathan stretched out his hand to strike Bacchides, but he eluded him and went to the rear.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.48">Then Jonathan and the men with him leaped into the Jordan and swam across to the other side, and the enemy did not cross the Jordan to attack them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.49">And about one thousand of Bacchides' men fell that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.50">Bacchides then returned to Jerusalem and built strong cities in Judea: the fortress in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Beth-horon, and Bethel, and Timnath, and Pharathon, and Tephon, with high walls and gates and bars.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.51">And he placed garrisons in them to harass Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.52">He also fortified the city of Beth-zur, and Gazara, and the citadel, and in them he put troops and stores of food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.53">And he took the sons of the leading men of the land as hostages and put them under guard in the citadel at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.54">In the one hundred and fifty-third year, in the second month, Alcimus gave orders to tear down the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary. He tore down the work of the prophets!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.55">But he only began to tear it down, for at that time Alcimus was stricken and his work was hindered; his mouth was stopped and he was paralyzed, so that he could no longer say a word or give commands concerning his house.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.56">And Alcimus died at that time in great agony.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.57">When Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king, and the land of Judah had rest for two years.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.58">Then all the lawless plotted and said, "See! Jonathan and his men are living in quiet and confidence. So now let us bring Bacchides back, and he will capture them all in one night."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.59">And they went and consulted with him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.60">He started to come with a large force, and secretly sent letters to all his allies in Judea, telling them to seize Jonathan and his men; but they were unable to do it, because their plan became known.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.61">And Jonathan's men seized about fifty of the men of the country who were leaders in this treachery, and killed them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.62">Then Jonathan with his men, and Simon, withdrew to Bethbasi in the wilderness; he rebuilt the parts of it that had been demolished, and they fortified it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.63">When Bacchides learned of this, he assembled all his forces, and sent orders to the men of Judea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.64">Then he came and encamped against Bethbasi; he fought against it for many days and made machines of war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.65">But Jonathan left Simon his brother in the city, while he went out into the country; and he went with only a few men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.66">He struck down Odomera and his brothers and the sons of Phasiron in their tents.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.67">Then he began to attack and went into battle with his forces; and Simon and his men sallied out from the city and set fire to the machines of war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.68">They fought with Bacchides, and he was crushed by them. They distressed him greatly, for his plan and his expedition had been in vain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.69">So he was greatly enraged at the lawless men who had counseled him to come into the country, and he killed many of them. Then he decided to depart to his own land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.70">When Jonathan learned of this, he sent ambassadors to him to make peace with him and obtain release of the captives.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.71">He agreed, and did as he said; and he swore to Jonathan that he would not try to harm him as long as he lived.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.72">He restored to him the captives whom he had formerly taken from the land of Judah; then he turned and departed to his own land, and came no more into their territory.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.9.73">Thus the sword ceased from Israel. And Jonathan dwelt in Michmash. And Jonathan began to judge the people, and he destroyed the ungodly out of Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Macc.10" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.1">In the one hundred and sixtieth year Alexander Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus, landed and occupied Ptolemais. They welcomed him, and there he began to reign.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.2">When Demetrius the king heard of it, he assembled a very large army and marched out to meet him in battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.3">And Demetrius sent Jonathan a letter in peaceable words to honor him;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.4">for he said, "Let us act first to make peace with him before he makes peace with Alexander against us,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.5">for he will remember all the wrongs which we did to him and to his brothers and his nation."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.6">So Demetrius gave him authority to recruit troops, to equip them with arms, and to become his ally; and he commanded that the hostages in the citadel should be released to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.7">Then Jonathan came to Jerusalem and read the letter in the hearing of all the people and of the men in the citadel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.8">They were greatly alarmed when they heard that the king had given him authority to recruit troops.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.9">But the men in the citadel released the hostages to Jonathan, and he returned them to their parents.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.10">And Jonathan dwelt in Jerusalem and began to rebuild and restore the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.11">He directed those who were doing the work to build the walls and encircle Mount Zion with squared stones, for better fortification; and they did so.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.12">Then the foreigners who were in the strongholds that Bacchides had built fled;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.13">each left his place and departed to his own land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.14">Only in Beth-zur did some remain who had forsaken the law and the commandments, for it served as a place of refuge.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.15">Now Alexander the king heard of all the promises which Demetrius had sent to Jonathan, and men told him of the battles that Jonathan and his brothers had fought, of the brave deeds that they had done, and of the troubles that they had endured.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.16">So he said, "Shall we find another such man? Come now, we will make him our friend and ally."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.17">And he wrote a letter and sent it to him, in the following words:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.18">"King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.19">We have heard about you, that you are a mighty warrior and worthy to be our friend.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.20">And so we have appointed you today to be the high priest of your nation; you are to be called the king's friend" (and he sent him a purple robe and a golden crown) "and you are to take our side and keep friendship with us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.21">So Jonathan put on the holy garments in the seventh month of the one hundred and sixtieth year, at the feast of tabernacles, and he recruited troops and equipped them with arms in abundance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.22">When Demetrius heard of these things he was grieved and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.23">"What is this that we have done? Alexander has gotten ahead of us in forming a friendship with the Jews to strengthen himself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.24">I also will write them words of encouragement and promise them honor and gifts, that I may have their help."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.25">So he sent a message to them in the following words: "King Demetrius to the nation of the Jews, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.26">Since you have kept your agreement with us and have continued your friendship with us, and have not sided with our enemies, we have heard of it and rejoiced.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.27">And now continue still to keep faith with us, and we will repay you with good for what you do for us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.28">We will grant you many immunities and give you gifts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.29">"And now I free you and exempt all the Jews from payment of tribute and salt tax and crown levies,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.30">and instead of collecting the third of the grain and the half of the fruit of the trees that I should receive, I release them from this day and henceforth. I will not collect them from the land of Judah or from the three districts added to it from Samaria and Galilee, from this day and for all time.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.31">And let Jerusalem and her environs, her tithes and her revenues, be holy and free from tax.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.32">I release also my control of the citadel in Jerusalem and give it to the high priest, that he may station in it men of his own choice to guard it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.33">And every one of the Jews taken as a captive from the land of Judah into any part of my kingdom, I set free without payment; and let all officials cancel also the taxes on their cattle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.34">"And all the feasts and sabbaths and new moons and appointed days, and the three days before a feast and the three after a feast -- let them all be days of immunity and release for all the Jews who are in my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.35">No one shall have authority to exact anything from them or annoy any of them about any matter.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.36">"Let Jews be enrolled in the king's forces to the number of thirty thousand men, and let the maintenance be given them that is due to all the forces of the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.37">Let some of them be stationed in the great strongholds of the king, and let some of them be put in positions of trust in the kingdom. Let their officers and leaders be of their own number, and let them live by their own laws, just as the king has commanded in the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.38">"As for the three districts that have been added to Judea from the country of Samaria, let them be so annexed to Judea that they are considered to be under one ruler and obey no other authority but the high priest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.39">Ptolemais and the land adjoining it I have given as a gift to the sanctuary in Jerusalem, to meet the necessary expenses of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.40">I also grant fifteen thousand shekels of silver yearly out of the king's revenues from appropriate places.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.41">And all the additional funds which the government officials have not paid as they did in the first years, they shall give from now on for the service of the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.42">Moreover, the five thousand shekels of silver which my officials have received every year from the income of the services of the temple, this too is canceled, because it belongs to the priests who minister there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.43">And whoever takes refuge at the temple in Jerusalem, or in any of its precincts, because he owes money to the king or has any debt, let him be released and receive back all his property in my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.44">"Let the cost of rebuilding and restoring the structures of the sanctuary be paid from the revenues of the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.45">And let the cost of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and fortifying it round about, and the cost of rebuilding the walls in Judea, also be paid from the revenues of the king."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.46">When Jonathan and the people heard these words, they did not believe or accept them, because they remembered the great wrongs which Demetrius had done in Israel and how he had greatly oppressed them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.47">They favored Alexander, because he had been the first to speak peaceable words to them, and they remained his allies all his days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.48">Now Alexander the king assembled large forces and encamped opposite Demetrius.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.49">The two kings met in battle, and the army of Demetrius fled, and Alexander pursued him and defeated them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.50">He pressed the battle strongly until the sun set, and Demetrius fell on that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.51">Then Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemy king of Egypt with the following message:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.52">"Since I have returned to my kingdom and have taken my seat on the throne of my fathers, and established my rule -- for I crushed Demetrius and gained control of our country;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.53">I met him in battle, and he and his army were crushed by us, and we have taken our seat on the throne of his kingdom --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.54">now therefore let us establish friendship with one another; give me now your daughter as my wife, and I will become your son-in-law, and will make gifts to you and to her in keeping with your position."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.55">Ptolemy the king replied and said, "Happy was the day on which you returned to the land of your fathers and took your seat on the throne of their kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.56">And now I will do for you as you wrote, but meet me at Ptolemais, so that we may see one another, and I will become your father-in-law, as you have said."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.57">So Ptolemy set out from Egypt, he and Cleopatra his daughter, and came to Ptolemais in the one hundred and sixty-second year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.58">Alexander the king met him, and Ptolemy gave him Cleopatra his daughter in marriage, and celebrated her wedding at Ptolemais with great pomp, as kings do.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.59">Then Alexander the king wrote to Jonathan to come to meet him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.60">So he went with pomp to Ptolemais and met the two kings; he gave them and their friends silver and gold and many gifts, and found favor with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.61">A group of pestilent men from Israel, lawless men, gathered together against him to accuse him; but the king paid no attention to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.62">The king gave orders to take off Jonathan's garments and to clothe him in purple, and they did so.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.63">The king also seated him at his side; and he said to his officers, "Go forth with him into the middle of the city and proclaim that no one is to bring charges against him about any matter, and let no one annoy him for any reason."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.64">And when his accusers saw the honor that was paid him, in accordance with the proclamation, and saw him clothed in purple, they all fled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.65">Thus the king honored him and enrolled him among his chief friends, and made him general and governor of the province.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.66">And Jonathan returned to Jerusalem in peace and gladness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.67">In the one hundred and sixty-fifth year Demetrius the son of Demetrius came from Crete to the land of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.68">When Alexander the king heard of it, he was greatly grieved and returned to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.69">And Demetrius appointed Apollonius the governor of Coelesyria, and he assembled a large force and encamped against Jamnia. Then he sent the following message to Jonathan the high priest:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.70">"You are the only one to rise up against us, and I have become a laughingstock and reproach because of you. Why do you assume authority against us in the hill country?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.71">If you now have confidence in your forces, come down to the plain to meet us, and let us match strength with each other there, for I have with me the power of the cities.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.72">Ask and learn who I am and who the others are that are helping us. Men will tell you that you cannot stand before us, for your fathers were twice put to flight in their own land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.73">And now you will not be able to withstand my cavalry and such an army in the plain, where there is no stone or pebble, or place to flee."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.74">When Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, his spirit was aroused. He chose ten thousand men and set out from Jerusalem, and Simon his brother met him to help him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.75">He encamped before Joppa, but the men of the city closed its gates, for Apollonius had a garrison in Joppa.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.76">So they fought against it, and the men of the city became afraid and opened the gates, and Jonathan gained possession of Joppa.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.77">When Apollonius heard of it, he mustered three thousand cavalry and a large army, and went to Azotus as though he were going farther. At the same time he advanced into the plain, for he had a large troop of cavalry and put confidence in it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.78">Jonathan pursued him to Azotus, and the armies engaged in battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.79">Now Apollonius had secretly left a thousand cavalry behind them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.80">Jonathan learned that there was an ambush behind him, for they surrounded his army and shot arrows at his men from early morning till late afternoon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.81">But his men stood fast, as Jonathan commanded, and the enemy's horses grew tired.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.82">Then Simon brought forward his force and engaged the phalanx in battle (for the cavalry was exhausted); they were overwhelmed by him and fled,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.83">and the cavalry was dispersed in the plain. They fled to Azotus and entered Beth-dagon, the temple of their idol, for safety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.84">But Jonathan burned Azotus and the surrounding towns and plundered them; and the temple of Dagon, and those who had taken refuge in it he burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.85">The number of those who fell by the sword, with those burned alive, came to eight thousand men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.86">Then Jonathan departed from there and encamped against Askalon, and the men of the city came out to meet him with great pomp.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.87">And Jonathan and those with him returned to Jerusalem with much booty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.88">When Alexander the king heard of these things, he honored Jonathan still more;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.10.89">and he sent to him a golden buckle, such as it is the custom to give to the kinsmen of kings. He also gave him Ekron and all its environs as his possession.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Macc.11" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.1">Then the king of Egypt gathered great forces, like the sand by the seashore, and many ships; and he tried to get possession of Alexander's kingdom by trickery and add it to his own kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.2">He set out for Syria with peaceable words, and the people of the cities opened their gates to him and went to meet him, for Alexander the king had commanded them to meet him, since he was Alexander's father-in-law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.3">But when Ptolemy entered the cities he stationed forces as a garrison in each city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.4">When he approached Azotus, they showed him the temple of Dagon burned down, and Azotus and its suburbs destroyed, and the corpses lying about, and the charred bodies of those whom Jonathan had burned in the war, for they had piled them in heaps along his route.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.5">They also told the king what Jonathan had done, to throw blame on him; but the king kept silent.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.6">Jonathan met the king at Joppa with pomp, and they greeted one another and spent the night there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.7">And Jonathan went with the king as far as the river called Eleutherus; then he returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.8">So King Ptolemy gained control of the coastal cities as far as Seleucia by the sea, and he kept devising evil designs against Alexander.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.9">He sent envoys to Demetrius the king, saying, "Come, let us make a covenant with each other, and I will give you in marriage my daughter who was Alexander's wife, and you shall reign over your father's kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.10">For I now regret that I gave him my daughter, for he has tried to kill me."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.11">He threw blame on Alexander because he coveted his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.12">So he took his daughter away from him and gave her to Demetrius. He was estranged from Alexander, and their enmity became manifest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.13">Then Ptolemy entered Antioch and put on the crown of Asia. Thus he put two crowns upon his head, the crown of Egypt and that of Asia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.14">Now Alexander the king was in Cilicia at that time, because the people of that region were in revolt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.15">And Alexander heard of it and came against him in battle. Ptolemy marched out and met him with a strong force, and put him to flight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.16">So Alexander fled into Arabia to find protection there, and King Ptolemy was exalted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.17">And Zabdiel the Arab cut off the head of Alexander and sent it to Ptolemy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.18">But King Ptolemy died three days later, and his troops in the strongholds were killed by the inhabitants of the strongholds.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.19">So Demetrius became king in the one hundred and sixty-seventh year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.20">In those days Jonathan assembled the men of Judea to attack the citadel in Jerusalem, and he built many engines of war to use against it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.21">But certain lawless men who hated their nation went to the king and reported to him that Jonathan was besieging the citadel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.22">When he heard this he was angry, and as soon as he heard it he set out and came to Ptolemais; and he wrote Jonathan not to continue the siege, but to meet him for a conference at Ptolemais as quickly as possible.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.23">When Jonathan heard this, he gave orders to continue the siege; and he chose some of the elders of Israel and some of the priests, and put himself in danger,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.24">for he went to the king at Ptolemais, taking silver and gold and clothing and numerous other gifts. And he won his favor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.25">Although certain lawless men of his nation kept making complaints against him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.26">the king treated him as his predecessors had treated him; he exalted him in the presence of all his friends.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.27">He confirmed him in the high priesthood and in as many other honors as he had formerly had, and made him to be regarded as one of his chief friends.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.28">Then Jonathan asked the king to free Judea and the three districts of Samaria from tribute, and promised him three hundred talents.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.29">The king consented, and wrote a letter to Jonathan about all these things; its contents were as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.30">"King Demetrius to Jonathan his brother and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.31">This copy of the letter which we wrote concerning you to Lasthenes our kinsman we have written to you also, so that you may know what it says.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.32">`King Demetrius to Lasthenes his father, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.33">To the nation of the Jews, who are our friends and fulfil their obligations to us, we have determined to do good, because of the good will they show toward us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.34">We have confirmed as their possession both the territory of Judea and the three districts of Aphairema and Lydda and Rathamin; the latter, with all the region bordering them, were added to Judea from Samaria. To all those who offer sacrifice in Jerusalem, we have granted release from the royal taxes which the king formerly received from them each year, from the crops of the land and the fruit of the trees.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.35">And the other payments henceforth due to us of the tithes, and the taxes due to us, and the salt pits and the crown taxes due to us -- from all these we shall grant them release.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.36">And not one of these grants shall be canceled from this time forth for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.37">Now therefore take care to make a copy of this, and let it be given to Jonathan and put up in a conspicuous place on the holy mountain.'"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.38">Now when Demetrius the king saw that the land was quiet before him and that there was no opposition to him, he dismissed all his troops, each man to his own place, except the foreign troops which he had recruited from the islands of the nations. So all the troops who had served his fathers hated him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.39">Now Trypho had formerly been one of Alexander's supporters. He saw that all the troops were murmuring against Demetrius. So he went to Imalkue the Arab, who was bringing up Antiochus, the young son of Alexander,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.40">and insistently urged him to hand Antiochus over to him, to become king in place of his father. He also reported to Imalkue what Demetrius had done and told of the hatred which the troops of Demetrius had for him; and he stayed there many days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.41">Now Jonathan sent to Demetrius the king the request that he remove the troops of the citadel from Jerusalem, and the troops in the strongholds; for they kept fighting against Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.42">And Demetrius sent this message to Jonathan, "Not only will I do these things for you and your nation, but I will confer great honor on you and your nation, if I find an opportunity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.43">Now then you will do well to send me men who will help me, for all my troops have revolted."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.44">So Jonathan sent three thousand stalwart men to him at Antioch, and when they came to the king, the king rejoiced at their arrival.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.45">Then the men of the city assembled within the city, to the number of a hundred and twenty thousand, and they wanted to kill the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.46">But the king fled into the palace. Then the men of the city seized the main streets of the city and began to fight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.47">So the king called the Jews to his aid, and they all rallied about him and then spread out through the city; and they killed on that day as many as a hundred thousand men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.48">They set fire to the city and seized much spoil on that day, and they saved the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.49">When the men of the city saw that the Jews had gained control of the city as they pleased, their courage failed and they cried out to the king with this entreaty,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.50">"Grant us peace, and make the Jews stop fighting against us and our city."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.51">And they threw down their arms and made peace. So the Jews gained glory in the eyes of the king and of all the people in his kingdom, and they returned to Jerusalem with much spoil.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.52">So Demetrius the king sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.53">But he broke his word about all that he had promised; and he became estranged from Jonathan and did not repay the favors which Jonathan had done him, but oppressed him greatly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.54">After this Trypho returned, and with him the young boy Antiochus who began to reign and put on the crown.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.55">All the troops that Demetrius had cast off gathered around him, and they fought against Demetrius, and he fled and was routed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.56">And Trypho captured the elephants and gained control of Antioch.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.57">Then the young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, "I confirm you in the high priesthood and set you over the four districts and make you one of the friends of the king."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.58">And he sent him gold plate and a table service, and granted him the right to drink from gold cups and dress in purple and wear a gold buckle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.59">Simon his brother he made governor from the Ladder of Tyre to the borders of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.60">Then Jonathan set forth and traveled beyond the river and among the cities, and all the army of Syria gathered to him as allies. When he came to Askalon, the people of the city met him and paid him honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.61">From there he departed to Gaza, but the men of Gaza shut him out. So he beseiged it and burned its suburbs with fire and plundered them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.62">Then the people of Gaza pleaded with Jonathan, and he made peace with them, and took the sons of their rulers as hostages and sent them to Jerusalem. And he passed through the country as far as Damascus.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.63">Then Jonathan heard that the officers of Demetrius had come to Kadesh in Galilee with a large army, intending to remove him from office.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.64">He went to meet them, but left his brother Simon in the country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.65">Simon encamped before Beth-zur and fought against it for many days and hemmed it in.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.66">Then they asked him to grant them terms of peace, and he did so. He removed them from there, took possession of the city, and set a garrison over it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.67">Jonathan and his army encamped by the waters of Gennesaret. Early in the morning they marched to the plain of Hazor,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.68">and behold, the army of the foreigners met him in the plain; they had set an ambush against him in the mountains, but they themselves met him face to face.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.69">Then the men in ambush emerged from their places and joined battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.70">All the men with Jonathan fled; not one of them was left except Mattathias the son of Absalom and Judas the son of Chalphi, commanders of the forces of the army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.71">Jonathan rent his garments and put dust on his head, and prayed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.72">Then he turned back to the battle against the enemy and routed them, and they fled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.73">When his men who were fleeing saw this, they returned to him and joined him in the pursuit as far as Kadesh, to their camp, and there they encamped.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.11.74">As many as three thousand of the foreigners fell that day. And Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Macc.12" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.1">Now when Jonathan saw that the time was favorable for him, he chose men and sent them to Rome to confirm and renew the friendship with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.2">He also sent letters to the same effect to the Spartans and to other places.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.3">So they went to Rome and entered the senate chamber and said, "Jonathan the high priest and the Jewish nation have sent us to renew the former friendship and alliance with them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.4">And the Romans gave them letters to the people in every place, asking them to provide for the envoys safe conduct to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.5">This is a copy of the letter which Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.6">"Jonathan the high priest, the senate of the nation, the priests, and the rest of the Jewish people to their brethren the Spartans, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.7">Already in time past a letter was sent to Onias the high priest from Arius, who was king among you, stating that you are our brethren, as the appended copy shows.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.8">Onias welcomed the envoy with honor, and received the letter, which contained a clear declaration of alliance and friendship.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.9">Therefore, though we have no need of these things, since we have as encouragement the holy books which are in our hands,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.10">we have undertaken to send to renew our brotherhood and friendship with you, so that we may not become estranged from you, for considerable time has passed since you sent your letter to us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.11">We therefore remember you constantly on every occasion, both in our feasts and on other appropriate days, at the sacrifices which we offer and in our prayers, as it is right and proper to remember brethren.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.12">And we rejoice in your glory.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.13">But as for ourselves, many afflictions and many wars have encircled us; the kings round about us have waged war against us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.14">We were unwilling to annoy you and our other allies and friends with these wars,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.15">for we have the help which comes from Heaven for our aid; and we were delivered from our enemies and our enemies were humbled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.16">We therefore have chosen Numenius the son of Antiochus and Antipater the son of Jason, and have sent them to Rome to renew our former friendship and alli   ance with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.17">We have commanded them to go also to you and greet you and deliver to you this letter from us concerning the renewal of our brotherhood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.18">And now please send us a reply to this."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.19">This is a copy of the letter which they sent to Onias:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.20">"Arius, king of the Spartans, to Onias the high priest, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.21">It has been found in writing concerning the Spartans and the Jews that they are brethren and are of the family of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.22">And now that we have learned this, please write us concerning your welfare;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.23">we on our part write to you that your cattle and your property belong to us, and ours belong to you. We therefore command that our envoys report to you accordingly."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.24">Now Jonathan heard that the commanders of Demetrius had returned, with a larger force than before, to wage war against him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.25">So he marched away from Jerusalem and met them in the region of Hamath, for he gave them no opportunity to invade his own country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.26">He sent spies to their camp, and they returned and reported to him that the enemy were being drawn up in formation to fall upon the Jews by night.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.27">So when the sun set, Jonathan commanded his men to be alert and to keep their arms at hand so as to be ready all night for battle, and he stationed outposts around the camp.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.28">When the enemy heard that Jonathan and his men were prepared for battle, they were afraid and were terrified at heart; so they kindled fires in their camp and withdrew.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.29">But Jonathan and his men did not know it until morning, for they saw the fires burning.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.30">Then Jonathan pursued them, but he did not overtake them, for they had crossed the Eleutherus river.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.31">So Jonathan turned aside against the Arabs who are called Zabadeans, and he crushed them and plundered them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.32">Then he broke camp and went to Damascus, and marched through all that region.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.33">Simon also went forth and marched through the country as far as Askalon and the neighboring strongholds. He turned aside to Joppa and took it by surprise,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.34">for he had heard that they were ready to hand over the stronghold to the men whom Demetrius had sent. And he stationed a garrison there to guard it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.35">When Jonathan returned he convened the elders of the people and planned with them to build strongholds in Judea,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.36">to build the walls of Jerusalem still higher, and to erect a high barrier between the citadel and the city to separate it from the city, in order to isolate it so that its garrison could neither buy nor sell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.37">So they gathered together to build up the city; part of the wall on the valley to the east had fallen, and he repaired the section called Chaphenatha.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.38">And Simon built Adida in the Shephelah; he fortified it and installed gates with bolts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.39">Then Trypho attempted to become king in Asia and put on the crown, and to raise his hand against Antiochus the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.40">He feared that Jonathan might not permit him to do so, but might make war on him, so he kept seeking to seize and kill him, and he marched forth and came to Beth-shan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.41">Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand picked fighting men, and he came to Beth-shan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.42">When Trypho saw that he had come with a large army, he was afraid to raise his hand against him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.43">So he received him with honor and commended him to all his friends, and he gave him gifts and commanded his friends and his troops to obey him as they would himself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.44">Then he said to Jonathan, "Why have you wearied all these people when we are not at war?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.45">Dismiss them now to their homes and choose for yourself a few men to stay with you, and come with me to Ptolemais. I will hand it over to you as well as the other strongholds and the remaining troops and all the officials, and will turn round and go home. For that is why I am here."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.46">Jonathan trusted him and did as he said; he sent away the troops, and they returned to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.47">He kept with himself three thousand men, two thousand of whom he left in Galilee, while a thousand accompanied him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.48">But when Jonathan entered Ptolemais, the men of Ptolemais closed the gates and seized him, and all who had entered with him they killed with the sword.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.49">Then Trypho sent troops and cavalry into Galilee and the Great Plain to destroy all Jonathan's soldiers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.50">But they realized that Jonathan had been seized and had perished along with his men, and they encouraged one another and kept marching in close formation, ready for battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.51">When their pursuers saw that they would fight for their lives, they turned back.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.52">So they all reached the land of Judah safely, and they mourned for Jonathan and his companions and were in great fear; and all Israel mourned deeply.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.12.53">And all the nations round about them tried to destroy them, for they said, "They have no leader or helper. Now therefore let us make war on them and blot out the memory of them from among men."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Macc.13" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.1">Simon heard that Trypho had assembled a large army to invade the land of Judah and destroy it,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.2">and he saw that the people were trembling and fearful. So he went up to Jerusalem, and gathering the people together</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.3">he encouraged them, saying to them, "You yourselves know what great things I and my brothers and the house of my father have done for the laws and the sanctuary; you know also the wars and the difficulties which we have seen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.4">By reason of this all my brothers have perished for the sake of Israel, and I alone am left.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.5">And now, far be it from me to spare my life in any time of distress, for I am not better than my brothers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.6">But I will avenge my nation and the sanctuary and your wives and children, for all the nations have gathered together out of hatred to destroy us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.7">The spirit of the people was rekindled when they heard these words,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.8">and they answered in a loud voice, "You are our leader in place of Judas and Jonathan your brother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.9">Fight our battles, and all that you say to us we will do."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.10">So he assembled all the warriors and hastened to complete the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it on every side.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.11">He sent Jonathan the son of Absalom to Joppa, and with him a considerable army; he drove out its occupants and remained there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.12">Then Trypho departed from Ptolemais with a large army to invade the land of Judah, and Jonathan was with him under guard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.13">And Simon encamped in Adida, facing the plain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.14">Trypho learned that Simon had risen up in place of Jonathan his brother, and that he was about to join battle with him, so he sent envoys to him and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.15">"It is for the money that Jonathan your brother owed the royal treasury, in connection with the offices he held, that we are detaining him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.16">Send now a hundred talents of silver and two of his sons as hostages, so that when released he will not revolt against us, and we will release him."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.17">Simon knew that they were speaking deceitfully to him, but he sent to get the money and the sons, lest he arouse great hostility among the people, who might say,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.18">"Because Simon did not send him the money and the sons, he perished."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.19">So he sent the sons and the hundred talents, but Trypho broke his word and did not release Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.20">After this Trypho came to invade the country and destroy it, and he circled around by the way to Adora. But Simon and his army kept marching along opposite him to every place he went.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.21">Now the men in the citadel kept sending envoys to Trypho urging him to come to them by way of the wilderness and to send them food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.22">So Trypho got all his cavalry ready to go, but that night a very heavy snow fell, and he did not go because of the snow. He marched off and went into the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.23">When he approached Baskama, he killed Jonathan, and he was buried there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.24">Then Trypho turned back and departed to his own land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.25">And Simon sent and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried him in Modein, the city of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.26">All Israel bewailed him with great lamentation, and mourned for him many days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.27">And Simon built a monument over the tomb of his father and his brothers; he made it high that it might be seen, with polished stone at the front and back.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.28">He also erected seven pyramids, opposite one another, for his father and mother and four brothers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.29">And for the pyramids he devised an elaborate setting, erecting about them great columns, and upon the columns he put suits of armor for a permanent memorial, and beside the suits of armor carved ships, so that they could be seen by all who sail the sea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.30">This is the tomb which he built in Modein; it remains to this day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.31">Trypho dealt treacherously with the young king Antiochus; he killed him</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.32">and became king in his place, putting on the crown of Asia; and he brought great calamity upon the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.33">But Simon built up the strongholds of Judea and walled them all around, with high towers and great walls and gates and bolts, and he stored food in the strongholds.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.34">Simon also chose men and sent them to Demetrius the king with a request to grant relief to the country, for all that Trypho did was to plunder.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.35">Demetrius the king sent him a favorable reply to this request, and wrote him a letter as follows,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.36">"King Demetrius to Simon, the high priest and friend of kings, and to the elders and nation of the Jews, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.37">We have received the gold crown and the palm branch which you sent, and we are ready to make a general peace with you and to write to our officials to grant you release from tribute.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.38">All the grants that we have made to you remain valid, and let the strongholds that you have built be your possession.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.39">We pardon any errors and offenses committed to this day, and cancel the crown tax which you owe; and whatever other tax has been collected in Jerusalem shall be collected no longer.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.40">And if any of you are qualified to be enrolled in our bodyguard, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.41">In the one hundred and seventieth year the yoke of the Gentiles was removed from Israel,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.42">and the people began to write in their documents and contracts, "In the first year of Simon the great high priest and commander and leader of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.43">In those days Simon encamped against Gazara and surrounded it with troops. He made a siege engine, brought it up to the city, and battered and captured one tower.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.44">The men in the siege engine leaped out into the city, and a great tumult arose in the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.45">The men in the city, with their wives and children, went up on the wall with their clothes rent, and they cried out with a loud voice, asking Simon to make peace with them;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.47">So Simon reached an agreement with them and stopped fighting against them. But he expelled them from the city and cleansed the houses in which the idols were, and then entered it with hymns and praise.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.48">He cast out of it all uncleanness, and settled in it men who observed the law. He also strengthened its fortifications and built in it a house for himself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.49">The men in the citadel at Jerusalem were prevented from going out to the country and back to buy and sell. So they were very hungry, and many of them perished from famine.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.50">Then they cried to Simon to make peace with them, and he did so. But he expelled them from there and cleansed the citadel from its pollutions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.51">On the twenty-third day of the second month, in the one hundred and seventy-first year, the Jews entered it with praise and palm branches, and with harps and cymbals and stringed instruments, and with hymns and songs, because a great enemy had been crushed and removed from Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.52">And Simon decreed that every year they should celebrate this day with rejoicing. He strengthened the fortifications of the temple hill alongside the citadel, and he and his men dwelt there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.13.53">And Simon saw that John his son had reached manhood, so he made him commander of all the forces, and he dwelt in Gazara.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.1">In the one hundred and seventy-second year Demetrius the king assembled his forces and marched into Media to secure help, so that he could make war against Trypho.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.2">When Arsaces the king of Persia and Media heard that Demetrius had invaded his territory, he sent one of his commanders to take him alive.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.3">And he went and defeated the army of Demetrius, and seized him and took him to Arsaces, who put him under guard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.4">The land had rest all the days of Simon. He sought the good of his nation; his rule was pleasing to them, as was the honor shown him, all his days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.5">To crown all his honors he took Joppa for a harbor, and opened a way to the isles of the sea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.6">He extended the borders of his nation, and gained full control of the country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.7">He gathered a host of captives; he ruled over Gazara and Beth-zur and the citadel, and he removed its uncleanness from it; and there was none to oppose him.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.14">He strengthened all the humble of his people; he sought out the law, and did away with every lawless and wicked man.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.15">He made the sanctuary glorious, and added to the vessels of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.16">It was heard in Rome, and as far away as Sparta, that Jonathan had died, and they were deeply grieved.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.17">When they heard that Simon his brother had become high priest in his place, and that he was ruling over the country and the cities in it,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.18">they wrote to him on bronze tablets to renew with him the friendship and alliance which they had established with Judas and Jonathan his brothers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.19">And these were read before the assembly in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.20">This is a copy of the letter which the Spartans sent: "The rulers and the city of the Spartans to Simon the high priest and to the elders and the priests and the rest of the Jewish people, our brethren, greeting.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.22">And what they said we have recorded in our public decrees, as follows, `Numenius the son of Antiochus and Antipater the son of Jason, envoys of the Jews, have come to us to renew their friendship with us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.23">It has pleased our people to receive these men with honor and to put a copy of their words in the public archives, so that the people of the Spartans may have a record of them. And they have sent a copy of this to Simon the high priest.'"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.24">After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a large gold shield weighing a thousand minas, to confirm the alliance with the Romans.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.25">When the people heard these things they said, "How shall we thank Simon and his sons?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.26">For he and his brothers and the house of his father have stood firm; they have fought and repulsed Israel's enemies and established its freedom."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.27">So they made a record on bronze tablets and put it upon pillars on Mount Zion. This is a copy of what they wrote: "On the eighteenth day of Elul, in the one hundred and seventy-second year, which is the third year of Simon the great high priest,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.28">in Asaramel, in the great assembly of the priests and the people and the rulers of the nation and the elders of the country, the following was proclaimed to us:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.29">"Since wars often occurred in the country, Simon the son of Mattathias, a priest of the sons of Joarib, and his brothers, exposed themselves to danger and resisted the enemies of their nation, in order that their sanctuary and the law might be perserved; and they brought great glory to their nation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.30">Jonathan rallied the nation, and became their high priest, and was gathered to his people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.31">And when their enemies decided to invade their country and lay hands on their sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.32">then Simon rose up and fought for his nation. He spent great sums of his own money; he armed the men of his nation's forces and paid them wages.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.33">He fortified the cities of Judea, and Beth-zur on the borders of Judea, where formerly the arms of the enemy had been stored, and he placed there a garrison of Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.34">He also fortified Joppa, which is by the sea, and Gazara, which is on the borders of Azotus, where the enemy formerly dwelt. He settled Jews there, and provided in those cities whatever was necessary for their restoration.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.35">"The people saw Simon's faithfulness and the glory which he had resolved to win for his nation, and they made him their leader and high priest, because he had done all these things and because of the justice and loyalty which he had maintained toward his nation. He sought in every way to exalt his people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.36">And in his days things prospered in his hands, so that the Gentiles were put out of the country, as were also the men in the city of David in Jerusalem, who had built themselves a citadel from which they used to sally forth and defile the environs of the sanctuary and do great damage to its purity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.37">He settled Jews in it, and fortified it for the safety of the country and of the city, and built the walls of Jerusalem higher.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.38">"In view of these things King Demetrius confirmed him in the high priesthood,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.39">and he made him one of the king's friends and paid him high honors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.40">For he had heard that the Jews were addressed by the Romans as friends and allies and brethren, and that the Romans had received the envoys of Simon with honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.41">"And the Jews and their priests decided that Simon should be their leader and high priest for ever, until a trustworthy prophet should arise,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.42">and that he should be governor over them and that he should take charge of the sanctuary and appoint men over its tasks and over the country and the weapons and the strongholds, and that he should take charge of the sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.43">and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all contracts in the country should be written in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple and wear gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.44">"And none of the people or priests shall be permitted to nullify any of these decisions or to oppose what he says, or to convene an assembly in the country without his permission, or to be clothed in purple or put on a gold buckle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.45">Whoever acts contrary to these decisions or nullifies any of them shall be liable to punishment."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.46">And all the people agreed to grant Simon the right to act in accord with these decisions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.47">So Simon accepted and agreed to be high priest, to be commander and ethnarch of the Jews and priests, and to be protector of them all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.48">And they gave orders to inscribe this decree upon bronze tablets, to put them up in a conspicuous place in the precincts of the sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.14.49">and to deposit copies of them in the treasury, so that Simon and his sons might have them.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.1">Antiochus, the son of Demetrius the king, sent a letter from the islands of the sea to Simon, the priest and ethnarch of the Jews, and to all the nation;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.2">its contents were as follows: "King Antiochus to Simon the high priest and ethnarch and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.3">Whereas certain pestilent men have gained control of the kingdom of our fathers, and I intend to lay claim to the kingdom so that I may restore it as it formerly was, and have recruited a host of mercenary troops and have equipped warships,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.4">and intend to make a landing in the country so that I may proceed against those who have destroyed our country and those who have devastated many cities in my kingdom,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.5">now therefore I confirm to you all the tax remissions that the kings before me have granted you, and release from all the other payments from which they have released you.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.6">I permit you to mint your own coinage as money for your country,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.7">and I grant freedom to Jerusalem and the sanctuary. All the weapons which you have prepared and the strongholds which you have built and now hold shall remain yours.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.8">Every debt you owe to the royal treasury and any such future debts shall be canceled for you from henceforth and for all time.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.9">When we gain control of our kingdom, we will bestow great honor upon you and your nation and the temple, so that your glory will become manifest in all the earth."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.10">In the one hundred and seventy-fourth year Antiochus set out and invaded the land of his fathers. All the troops rallied to him, so that there were few with Trypho.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.11">Antiochus pursued him, and he came in his flight to Dor, which is by the sea;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.12">for he knew that troubles had converged upon him, and his troops had deserted him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.13">So Antiochus encamped against Dor, and with him were a hundred and twenty thousand warriors and eight thousand cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.14">He surrounded the city, and the ships joined battle from the sea; he pressed the city hard from land and sea, and permitted no one to leave or enter it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.15">Then Numenius and his companions arrived from Rome, with letters to the kings and countries, in which the following was written:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.16">"Lucius, consul of the Romans, to King Ptolemy, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.17">The envoys of the Jews have come to us as our friends and allies to renew our ancient friendship and alliance. They had been sent by Simon the high priest and by the people of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.18">and have brought a gold shield weighing a thousand minas.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.19">We therefore have decided to write to the kings and countries that they should not seek their harm or make war against them and their cities and their country, or make alliance with those who war against them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.20">And it has seemed good to us to accept the shield from them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.21">Therefore if any pestilent men have fled to you from their country, hand them over to Simon the high priest, that he may punish them according to their law."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.22">The consul wrote the same thing to Demetrius the king and to Attalus and Ariarathes and Arsaces,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.23">and to all the countries, and to Sampsames, and to the Spartans, and to Delos, and to Myndos, and to Sicyon, and to Caria, and to Samos, and to Pamphylia, and to Lycia, and to Halicarnassus, and to Rhodes, and to Phaselis, and to Cos, and to Side, and to Aradus and Gortyna and Cnidus and Cyprus and Cyrene.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.24">They also sent a copy of these things to Simon the high priest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.25">Antiochus the king besieged Dor anew, continually throwing his forces against it and making engines of war; and he shut Trypho up and kept him from going out or in.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.26">And Simon sent to Antiochus two thousand picked men, to fight for him, and silver and gold and much military equipment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.27">But he refused to receive them, and he broke all the agreements he formerly had made with Simon, and became estranged from him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.28">He sent to him Athenobius, one of his friends, to confer with him, saying, "You hold control of Joppa and Gazara and the citadel in Jerusalem; they are cities of my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.29">You have devastated their territory, you have done great damage in the land, and you have taken possession of many places in my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.30">Now then, hand over the cities which you have seized and the tribute money of the places which you have conquered outside the borders of Judea;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.31">or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver, and for the destruction that you have caused and the tribute money of the cities, five hundred talents more. Otherwise we will come and conquer you."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.32">So Athenobius the friend of the king came to Jerusalem, and when he saw the splendor of Simon, and the sideboard with its gold and silver plate, and his great magnificence, he was amazed. He reported to him the words of the king,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.33">but Simon gave him this reply: "We have neither taken foreign land nor seized foreign property, but only the inheritance of our fathers, which at one time had been unjustly taken by our enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.34">Now that we have the opportunity, we are firmly holding the inheritance of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.35">As for Joppa and Gazara, which you demand, they were causing great damage among the people and to our land; for them we will give you a hundred talents." Athenobius did not answer him a word,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.36">but returned in wrath to the king and reported to him these words and the splendor of Simon and all that he had seen. And the king was greatly angered.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.37">Now Trypho embarked on a ship and escaped to Orthosia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.38">Then the king made Cendebeus commander-in-chief of the coastal country, and gave him troops of infantry and cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.39">He commanded him to encamp against Judea, and commanded him to build up Kedron and fortify its gates, and to make war on the people; but the king pursued Trypho.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.40">So Cendebeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the people and invade Judea and take the people captive and kill them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.15.41">He built up Kedron and stationed there horsemen and troops, so that they might go out and make raids along the highways of Judea, as the king had ordered him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="1Macc.16" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.1">John went up from Gazara and reported to Simon his father what Cendebeus had done.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.2">And Simon called in his two older sons Judas and John, and said to them: "I and my brothers and the house of my father have fought the wars of Israel from our youth until this day, and things have prospered in our hands so that we have delivered Israel many times.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.3">But now I have grown old, and you by His mercy are mature in years. Take my place and my brother's, and go out and fight for our nation, and may the help which comes from Heaven be with you."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.4">So John chose out of the country twenty thousand warriors and horsemen, and they marched against Cendebeus and camped for the night in Modein.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.5">Early in the morning they arose and marched into the plain, and behold, a large force of infantry and horsemen was coming to meet them; and a stream lay between them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.6">Then he and his army lined up against them. And he saw that the soldiers were afraid to cross the stream, so he crossed over first; and when his men saw him, they crossed over after him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.7">Then he divided the army and placed the horsemen in the midst of the infantry, for the cavalry of the enemy were very numerous.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.8">And they sounded the trumpets, and Cendebeus and his army were put to flight, and many of them were wounded and fell; the rest fled into the stronghold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.9">At that time Judas the brother of John was wounded, but John pursued them until Cendebeus reached Kedron, which he had built.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.10">They also fled into the towers that were in the fields of Azotus, and John burned it with fire, and about two thousand of them fell. And he returned to Judea safely.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.11">Now Ptolemy the son of Abubus had been appointed governor over the plain of Jericho, and he had much silver and gold,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.12">for he was son-in-law of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.13">His heart was lifted up; he determined to get control of the country, and made treacherous plans against Simon and his sons, to do away with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.14">Now Simon was visiting the cities of the country and attending to their needs, and he went down to Jericho with Mattathias and Judas his sons, in the one hundred and seventy-seventh year, in the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.15">The son of Abubus received them treacherously in the little stronghold called Dok, which he had built; he gave them a great banquet, and hid men there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.16">When Simon and his sons were drunk, Ptolemy and his men rose up, took their weapons, and rushed in against Simon in the banquet hall, and they killed him and his two sons and some of his servants.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.17">So he committed an act of great treachery and returned evil for good.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.18">Then Ptolemy wrote a report about these things and sent it to the king, asking him to send troops to aid him and to turn over to him the cities and the country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.19">He sent other men to Gazara to do away with John; he sent letters to the captains asking them to come to him so that he might give them silver and gold and gifts;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.20">and he sent other men to take possession of Jerusalem and the temple hill.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.21">But some one ran ahead and reported to John at Gazara that his father and brothers had perished, and that "he has sent men to kill you also."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.22">When he heard this, he was greatly shocked; and he seized the men who came to destroy him and killed them, for he had found out that they were seeking to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.23">The rest of the acts of John and his wars and the brave deeds which he did, and the building of the walls which he built, and his achievements,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="1Macc.16.24">behold, they are written in the chronicles of his high priesthood, from the time that he became high priest after his father.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.7">In the reign of Demetrius, in the one hundred and sixty-ninth year, we Jews wrote to you, in the critical distress which came upon us in those years after Jason and his company revolted from the holy land and the kingdom</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.8">and burned the gate and shed innocent blood. We besought the Lord and we were heard, and we offered sacrifice and cereal offering, and we lighted the lamps and we set out the loaves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.9">And now see that you keep the feast of booths in the month of Chislev, in the one hundred and eighty-eighth year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.10">Those in Jerusalem and those in Judea and the senate and Judas, To Aristobulus, who is of the family of the anointed priests, teacher of Ptolemy the king, and to the Jews in Egypt, Greeting, and good health.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.11">Having been saved by God out of grave dangers we thank him greatly for taking our side against the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.12">For he drove out those who fought against the holy city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.13">For when the leader reached Persia with a force that seemed irresistible, they were cut to pieces in the temple of Nanea by a deception employed by the priests of Nanea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.14">For under pretext of intending to marry her, Antiochus came to the place together with his friends, to secure most of its treasures as a dowry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.15">When the priests of the temple of Nanea had set out the treasures and Antiochus had come with a few men inside the wall of the sacred precinct, they closed the temple as soon as he entered it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.16">Opening the secret door in the ceiling, they threw stones and struck down the leader and his men, and dismembered them and cut off their heads and threw them to the people outside.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.17">Blessed in every way be our God, who has brought judgment upon those who have behaved impiously.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.18">Since on the twenty-fifth day of Chislev we shall celebrate the purification of the temple, we thought it necessary to notify you, in order that you also may celebrate the feast of booths and the feast of the fire given when Nehemiah, who built the temple and the altar, offered sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.19">For when our fathers were being led captive to Persia, the pious priests of that time took some of the fire of the altar and secretly hid it in the hollow of a dry cistern, where they took such precautions that the place was unknown to any one.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.20">But after many years had passed, when it pleased God, Nehemiah, having been commissioned by the king of Persia, sent the descendants of the priests who had hidden the fire to get it. And when they reported to us that they had not found fire but thick liquid, he ordered them to dip it out and bring it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.21">And when the materials for the sacrifices were presented, Nehemiah ordered the priests to sprinkle the liquid on the wood and what was laid upon it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.22">When this was done and some time had passed and the sun, which had been clouded over, shone out, a great fire blazed up, so that all marveled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.23">And while the sacrifice was being consumed, the priests offered prayer -- the priests and every one. Jonathan led, and the rest responded, as did Nehemiah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.24">The prayer was to this effect: "O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, who art awe-inspiring and strong and just and merciful, who alone art King and art kind,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.25">who alone art bountiful, who alone art just and almighty and eternal, who dost rescue Israel from every evil, who didst choose the fathers and consecrate them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.26">accept this sacrifice on behalf of all thy people Israel and preserve thy portion and make it holy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.27">Gather together our scattered people, set free those who are slaves among the Gentiles, look upon those who are rejected and despised, and let the Gentiles know that thou art our God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.28">Afflict those who oppress and are insolent with pride.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.29">Plant thy people in thy holy place, as Moses said."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.30">Then the priests sang the hymns.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.31">And when the materials of the sacrifice were consumed, Nehemiah ordered that the liquid that was left should be poured upon large stones.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.32">When this was done, a flame blazed up; but when the light from the altar shone back, it went out.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.33">When this matter became known, and it was reported to the king of the Persians that, in the place where the exiled priests had hidden the fire, the liquid had appeared with which Nehemiah and his associates had burned the materials of the sacrifice,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.34">the king investigated the matter, and enclosed the place and made it sacred.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.35">And with those persons whom the king favored he exchanged many excellent gifts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.1.36">Nehemiah and his associates called this "nephthar," which means purification, but by most people it is called naphtha.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Macc.2" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.1">One finds in the records that Jeremiah the prophet ordered those who were being deported to take some of the fire, as has been told,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.2">and that the prophet after giving them the law instructed those who were being deported not to forget the commandments of the Lord, nor to be led astray in their thoughts upon seeing the gold and silver statues and their adornment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.3">And with other similar words he exhorted them that the law should not depart from their hearts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.4">It was also in the writing that the prophet, having received an oracle, ordered that the tent and the ark should follow with him, and that he went out to the mountain where Moses had gone up and had seen the inheritance of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.5">And Jeremiah came and found a cave, and he brought there the tent and the ark and the altar of incense, and he sealed up the entrance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.6">Some of those who followed him came up to mark the way, but could not find it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.7">When Jeremiah learned of it, he rebuked them and declared: "The place shall be unknown until God gathers his people together again and shows his mercy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.8">And then the Lord will disclose these things, and the glory of the Lord and the cloud will appear, as they were shown in the case of Moses, and as Solomon asked that the place should be specially consecrated."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.9">It was also made clear that being possessed of wisdom Solomon offered sacrifice for the dedication and completion of the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.10">Just as Moses prayed to the Lord, and fire came down from heaven and devoured the sacrifices, so also Solomon prayed, and the fire came down and consumed the whole burnt offerings.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.11">And Moses said, "They were consumed because the sin offering had not been eaten."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.12">Likewise Solomon also kept the eight days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.13">The same things are reported in the records and in the memoirs of Nehemiah, and also that he founded a library and collected the books about the kings and prophets, and the writings of David, and letters of kings about votive offerings.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.14">In the same way Judas also collected all the books that had been lost on account of the war which had come upon us, and they are in our possession.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.15">So if you have need of them, send people to get them for you.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.16">Since, therefore, we are about to celebrate the purification, we write to you. Will you therefore please keep the days?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.17">It is God who has saved all his people, and has returned the inheritance to all, and the kingship and priesthood and consecration,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.18">as he promised through the law. For we have hope in God that he will soon have mercy upon us and will gather us from everywhere under heaven into his holy place, for he has rescued us from great evils and has purified the place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.19">The story of Judas Maccabeus and his brothers, and the purification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.21">and the appearances which came from heaven to those who strove zealously on behalf of Judaism, so that though few in number they seized the whole land and pursued the barbarian hordes,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.22">and recovered the temple famous throughout the world and freed the city and restored the laws that were about to be abolished, while the Lord with great kindness became gracious to them --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.23">all this, which has been set forth by Jason of Cyrene in five volumes, we shall attempt to condense into a single book.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.24">For considering the flood of numbers involved and the difficulty there is for those who wish to enter upon the narratives of history because of the mass of material,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.25">we have aimed to please those who wish to read, to make it easy for those who are inclined to memorize, and to profit all readers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.26">For us who have undertaken the toil of abbreviating, it is no light matter but calls for sweat and loss of sleep,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.27">just as it is not easy for one who prepares a banquet and seeks the benefit of others. However, to secure the gratitude of many we will gladly endure the uncomfortable toil,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.28">leaving the responsibility for exact details to the compiler, while devoting our effort to arriving at the outlines of the condensation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.29">For as the master builder of a new house must be concerned with the whole construction, while the one who undertakes its painting and decoration has to consider only what is suitable for its adornment, such in my judgment is the case with us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.30">It is the duty of the original historian to occupy the ground and to discuss matters from every side and to take trouble with details,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.31">but the one who recasts the narrative should be allowed to strive for brevity of expression and to forego exhaustive treatment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.2.32">At this point therefore let us begin our narrative, adding only so much to what has already been said; for it is foolish to lengthen the preface while cutting short the history itself.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Macc.3" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.1">While the holy city was inhabited in unbroken peace and the laws were very well observed because of the piety of the high priest Onias and his hatred of wickedness,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.2">it came about that the kings themselves honored the place and glorified the temple with the finest presents,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.3">so that even Seleucus, the king of Asia, defrayed from his own revenues all the expenses connected with the service of the sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.4">But a man named Simon, of the tribe of Benjamin, who had been made captain of the temple, had a disagreement with the high priest about the administration of the city market;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.5">and when he could not prevail over Onias he went to Apollonius of Tarsus, who at that time was governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.6">He reported to him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of untold sums of money, so that the amount of the funds could not be reckoned, and that they did not belong to the account of the sacrifices, but that it was possible for them to fall under the control of the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.7">When Apollonius met the king, he told him of the money about which he had been informed. The king chose Heliodorus, who was in charge of his affairs, and sent him with commands to effect the removal of the aforesaid money.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.8">Heliodorus at once set out on his journey, ostensibly to make a tour of inspection of the cities of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, but in fact to carry out the king's purpose.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.9">When he had arrived at Jerusalem and had been kindly welcomed by the high priest of the city, he told about the disclosure that had been made and stated why he had come, and he inquired whether this really was the situation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.10">The high priest explained that there were some deposits belonging to widows and orphans,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.11">and also some money of Hyrcanus, son of Tobias, a man of very prominent position, and that it totaled in all four hundred talents of silver and two hundred of gold. To such an extent the impious Simon had misrepresented the facts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.12">And he said that it was utterly impossible that wrong should be done to those people who had trusted in the holiness of the place and in the sanctity and inviolability of the temple which is honored throughout the whole world.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.13">But Heliodorus, because of the king's commands which he had, said that this money must in any case be confiscated for the king's treasury.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.14">So he set a day and went in to direct the inspection of these funds. There was no little distress throughout the whole city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.15">The priests prostrated themselves before the altar in their priestly garments and called toward heaven upon him who had given the law about deposits, that he should keep them safe for those who had deposited them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.16">To see the appearance of the high priest was to be wounded at heart, for his face and the change in his color disclosed the anguish of his soul.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.17">For terror and bodily trembling had come over the man, which plainly showed to those who looked at him the pain lodged in his heart.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.18">People also hurried out of their houses in crowds to make a general supplication because the holy place was about to be brought into contempt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.19">Women, girded with sackcloth under their breasts, thronged the streets. Some of the maidens who were kept indoors ran together to the gates, and some to the walls, while others peered out of the windows.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.20">And holding up their hands to heaven, they all made entreaty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.21">There was something pitiable in the prostration of the whole populace and the anxiety of the high priest in his great anguish.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.22">While they were calling upon the Almighty Lord that he would keep what had been entrusted safe and secure for those who had entrusted it,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.23">Heliodorus went on with what had been decided.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.24">But when he arrived at the treasury with his bodyguard, then and there the Sovereign of spirits and of all authority caused so great a manifestation that all who had been so bold as to accompany him were astounded by the power of God, and became faint with terror.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.25">For there appeared to them a magnificently caparisoned horse, with a rider of frightening mien, and it rushed furiously at Heliodorus and struck at him with its front hoofs. Its rider was seen to have armor and weapons of gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.26">Two young men also appeared to him, remarkably strong, gloriously beautiful and splendidly dressed, who stood on each side of him and scourged him continuously, inflicting many blows on him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.27">When he suddenly fell to the ground and deep darkness came over him, his men took him up and put him on a stretcher</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.28">and carried him away, this man who had just entered the aforesaid treasury with a great retinue and all his bodyguard but was now unable to help himself; and they recognized clearly the sovereign power of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.29">While he lay prostrate, speechless because of the divine intervention and deprived of any hope of recovery,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.30">they praised the Lord who had acted marvelously for his own place. And the temple, which a little while before was full of fear and disturbance, was filled with joy and gladness, now that the Almighty Lord had appeared.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.31">Quickly some of Heliodorus' friends asked Onias to call upon the Most High and to grant life to one who was lying quite at his last breath.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.32">And the high priest, fearing that the king might get the notion that some foul play had been perpetrated by the Jews with regard to Heliodorus, offered sacrifice for the man's recovery.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.33">While the high priest was making the offering of atonement, the same young men appeared again to Heliodorus dressed in the same clothing, and they stood and said, "Be very grateful to Onias the high priest, since for his sake the Lord has granted you your life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.34">And see that you, who have been scourged by heaven, report to all men the majestic power of God." Having said this they vanished.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.35">Then Heliodorus offered sacrifice to the Lord and made very great vows to the Savior of his life, and having bidden Onias farewell, he marched off with his forces to the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.36">And he bore testimony to all men of the deeds of the supreme God, which he had seen with his own eyes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.37">When the king asked Heliodorus what sort of person would be suitable to send on another mission to Jerusalem, he replied,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.38">"If you have any enemy or plotter against your government, send him there, for you will get him back thoroughly scourged, if he escapes at all, for there certainly is about the place some power of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.39">For he who has his dwelling in heaven watches over that place himself and brings it aid, and he strikes and destroys those who come to do it injury."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.3.40">This was the outcome of the episode of Heliodorus and the protection of the treasury.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Macc.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.1">The previously mentioned Simon, who had informed about the money against his own country, slandered Onias, saying that it was he who had incited Heliodorus and had been the real cause of the misfortune.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.2">He dared to designate as a plotter against the government the man who was the benefactor of the city, the protector of his fellow countrymen, and a zealot for the laws.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.3">When his hatred progressed to such a degree that even murders were committed by one of Simon's approved agents,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.4">Onias recognized that the rivalry was serious and that Apollonius, the son of Menestheus and governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, was intensifying the malice of Simon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.5">So he betook himself to the king, not accusing his fellow citizens but having in view the welfare, both public and private, of all the people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.6">For he saw that without the king's attention public affairs could not again reach a peaceful settlement, and that Simon would not stop his folly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.7">When Seleucus died and Antiochus who was called Epiphanes succeeded to the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias obtained the high priesthood by corruption,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.8">promising the king at an interview three hundred and sixty talents of silver and, from another source of revenue, eighty talents.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.9">In addition to this he promised to pay one hundred and fifty more if permission were given to establish by his authority a gymnasium and a body of youth for it, and to enrol the men of Jerusalem as citizens of Antioch.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.10">When the king assented and Jason came to office, he at once shifted his countrymen over to the Greek way of life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.11">He set aside the existing royal concessions to the Jews, secured through John the father of Eupolemus, who went on the mission to establish friendship and alliance with the Romans; and he destroyed the lawful ways of living and introduced new customs contrary to the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.12">For with alacrity he founded a gymnasium right under the citadel, and he induced the noblest of the young men to wear the Greek hat.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.13">There was such an extreme of Hellenization and increase in the adoption of foreign ways because of the surpassing wickedness of Jason, who was ungodly and no high priest,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.14">that the priests were no longer intent upon their service at the altar. Despising the sanctuary and neglecting the sacrifices, they hastened to take part in the unlawful proceedings in the wrestling arena after the call to the discus,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.15">disdaining the honors prized by their fathers and putting the highest value upon Greek forms of prestige.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.16">For this reason heavy disaster overtook them, and those whose ways of living they admired and wished to imitate completely became their enemies and punished them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.17">For it is no light thing to show irreverence to the divine laws -- a fact which later events will make clear.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.18">When the quadrennial games were being held at Tyre and the king was present,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.19">the vile Jason sent envoys, chosen as being Antiochian citizens from Jerusalem, to carry three hundred silver drachmas for the sacrifice to Hercules. Those who carried the money, however, thought best not to use it for sacrifice, because that was inappropriate, but to expend it for another purpose.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.20">So this money was intended by the sender for the sacrifice to Hercules, but by the decision of its carriers it was applied to the construction of triremes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.21">When Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent to Egypt for the coronation of Philometor as king, Antiochus learned that Philometor had become hostile to his government, and he took measures for his own security. Therefore upon arriving at Joppa he proceeded to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.22">He was welcomed magnificently by Jason and the city, and ushered in with a blaze of torches and with shouts. Then he marched into Phoenicia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.23">After a period of three years Jason sent Menelaus, the brother of the previously mentioned Simon, to carry the money to the king and to complete the records of essential business.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.24">But he, when presented to the king, extolled him with an air of authority, and secured the high priesthood for himself, outbidding Jason by three hundred talents of silver.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.25">After receiving the king's orders he returned, possessing no qualification for the high priesthood, but having the hot temper of a cruel tyrant and the rage of a savage wild beast.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.26">So Jason, who after supplanting his own brother was supplanted by another man, was driven as a fugitive into the land of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.27">And Menelaus held the office, but he did not pay regularly any of the money promised to the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.28">When Sostratus the captain of the citadel kept requesting payment, for the collection of the revenue was his responsibility, the two of them were summoned by the king on account of this issue.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.29">Menelaus left his own brother Lysimachus as deputy in the high priesthood, while Sostratus left Crates, the commander of the Cyprian troops.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.30">While such was the state of affairs, it happened that the people of Tarsus and of Mallus revolted because their cities had been given as a present to Antiochis, the king's concubine.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.31">So the king went hastily to settle the trouble, leaving Andronicus, a man of high rank, to act as his deputy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.32">But Menelaus, thinking he had obtained a suitable opportunity, stole some of the gold vessels of the temple and gave them to Andronicus; other vessels, as it happened, he had sold to Tyre and the neighboring cities.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.33">When Onias became fully aware of these acts he publicly exposed them, having first withdrawn to a place of sanctuary at Daphne near Antioch.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.34">Therefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus aside, urged him to kill Onias. Andronicus came to Onias, and resorting to treachery offered him sworn pledges and gave him his right hand, and in spite of his suspicion persuaded Onias to come out from the place of sanctuary; then, with no regard for justice, he immediately put him out of the way.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.35">For this reason not only Jews, but many also of other nations, were grieved and displeased at the unjust murder of the man.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.36">When the king returned from the region of Cilicia, the Jews in the city appealed to him with regard to the unreasonable murder of Onias, and the Greeks shared their hatred of the crime.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.37">Therefore Antiochus was grieved at heart and filled with pity, and wept because of the moderation and good conduct of the deceased;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.38">and inflamed with anger, he immediately stripped off the purple robe from Andronicus, tore off his garments, and led him about the whole city to that very place where he had committed the outrage against Onias, and there he dispatched the bloodthirsty fellow. The Lord thus repaid him with the punishment he deserved.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.39">When many acts of sacrilege had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the connivance of Menelaus, and when report of them had spread abroad, the populace gathered against Lysimachus, because many of the gold vessels had already been stolen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.40">And since the crowds were becoming aroused and filled with anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men and launched an unjust attack, under the leadership of a certain Auranus, a man advanced in years and no less advanced in folly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.41">But when the Jews became aware of Lysimachus' attack, some picked up stones, some blocks of wood, and others took handfuls of the ashes that were lying about, and threw them in wild confusion at Lysimachus and his men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.42">As a result, they wounded many of them, and killed some, and put them all to flight; and the temple robber himself they killed close by the treasury.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.43">Charges were brought against Menelaus about this incident.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.44">When the king came to Tyre, three men sent by the senate presented the case before him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.45">But Menelaus, already as good as beaten, promised a substantial bribe to Ptolemy son of Dorymenes to win over the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.46">Therefore Ptolemy, taking the king aside into a colonnade as if for refreshment, induced the king to change his mind.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.47">Menelaus, the cause of all the evil, he acquitted of the charges against him, while he sentenced to death those unfortunate men, who would have been freed uncondemned if they had pleaded even before Scythians.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.48">And so those who had spoken for the city and the villages and the holy vessels quickly suffered the unjust penalty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.49">Therefore even the Tyrians, showing their hatred of the crime, provided magnificently for their funeral.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.4.50">But Menelaus, because of the cupidity of those in power, remained in office, growing in wickedness, having become the chief plotter against his fellow citizens.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Macc.5" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.1">About this time Antiochus made his second invasion of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.2">And it happened that over all the city, for almost forty days, there appeared golden-clad horsemen charging through the air, in companies fully armed with lances and drawn swords --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.3">troops of horsemen drawn up, attacks and counterattacks made on this side and on that, brandishing of shields, massing of spears, hurling of missiles, the flash of golden trappings, and armor of all sorts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.4">Therefore all men prayed that the apparition might prove to have been a good omen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.5">When a false rumor arose that Antiochus was dead, Jason took no less than a thousand men and suddenly made an assault upon the city. When the troops upon the wall had been forced back and at last the city was being taken, Menelaus took refuge in the citadel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.6">But Jason kept relentlessly slaughtering his fellow citizens, not realizing that success at the cost of one's kindred is the greatest misfortune, but imagining that he was setting up trophies of victory over enemies and not over fellow countrymen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.7">He did not gain control of the government, however; and in the end got only disgrace from his conspiracy, and fled again into the country of the Ammonites.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.8">Finally he met a miserable end. Accused before Aretas the ruler of the Arabs, fleeing from city to city, pursued by all men, hated as a rebel against the laws, and abhorred as the executioner of his country and his fellow citizens, he was cast ashore in Egypt;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.9">and he who had driven many from their own country into exile died in exile, having embarked to go to the Lacedaemonians in hope of finding protection because of their kinship.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.10">He who had cast out many to lie unburied had no one to mourn for him; he had no funeral of any sort and no place in the tomb of his fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.11">When news of what had happened reached the king, he took it to mean that Judea was in revolt. So, raging inwardly, he left Egypt and took the city by storm.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.12">And he commanded his soldiers to cut down relentlessly every one they met and to slay those who went into the houses.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.13">Then there was killing of young and old, destruction of boys, women, and children, and slaughter of virgins and infants.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.14">Within the total of three days eighty thousand were destroyed, forty thousand in hand-to-hand fighting; and as many were sold into slavery as were slain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.15">Not content with this, Antiochus dared to enter the most holy temple in all the world, guided by Menelaus, who had become a traitor both to the laws and to his country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.16">He took the holy vessels with his polluted hands, and swept away with profane hands the votive offerings which other kings had made to enhance the glory and honor of the place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.17">Antiochus was elated in spirit, and did not perceive that the Lord was angered for a little while because of the sins of those who dwelt in the city, and that therefore he was disregarding the holy place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.18">But if it had not happened that they were involved in many sins, this man would have been scourged and turned back from his rash act as soon as he came forward, just as Heliodorus was, whom Seleucus the king sent to inspect the treasury.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.19">But the Lord did not choose the nation for the sake of the holy place, but the place for the sake of the nation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.20">Therefore the place itself shared in the misfortunes that befell the nation and afterward participated in its benefits; and what was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty was restored again in all its glory when the great Lord became reconciled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.21">So Antiochus carried off eighteen hundred talents from the temple, and hurried away to Antioch, thinking in his arrogance that he could sail on the land and walk on the sea, because his mind was elated.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.22">And he left governors to afflict the people: at Jerusalem, Philip, by birth a Phrygian and in character more barbarous than the man who appointed him;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.23">and at Gerizim, Andronicus; and besides these Menelaus, who lorded it over his fellow citizens worse than the others did. In his malice toward the Jewish citizens,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.24">Antiochus sent Apollonius, the captain of the Mysians, with an army of twenty-two thousand, and commanded him to slay all the grown men and to sell the women and boys as slaves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.25">When this man arrived in Jerusalem, he pretended to be peaceably disposed and waited until the holy sabbath day; then, finding the Jews not at work, he ordered his men to parade under arms.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.26">He put to the sword all those who came out to see them, then rushed into the city with his armed men and killed great numbers of people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.5.27">But Judas Maccabeus, with about nine others, got away to the wilderness, and kept himself and his companions alive in the mountains as wild animals do; they continued to live on what grew wild, so that they might not share in the defilement.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Macc.6" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.1">Not long after this, the king sent an Athenian senator to compel the Jews to forsake the laws of their fathers and cease to live by the laws of God,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.2">and also to pollute the temple in Jerusalem and call it the temple of Olympian Zeus, and to call the one in Gerizim the temple of Zeus the Friend of Strangers, as did the people who dwelt in that place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.3">Harsh and utterly grievous was the onslaught of evil.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.4">For the temple was filled with debauchery and reveling by the Gentiles, who dallied with harlots and had intercourse with women within the sacred precincts, and besides brought in things for sacrifice that were unfit.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.5">The altar was covered with abominable offerings which were forbidden by the laws.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.6">A man could neither keep the sabbath, nor observe the feasts of his fathers, nor so much as confess himself to be a Jew.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.7">On the monthly celebration of the king's birthday, the Jews were taken, under bitter constraint, to partake of the sacrifices; and when the feast of Dionysus came, they were compelled to walk in the procession in honor of Dionysus, wearing wreaths of ivy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.8">At the suggestion of Ptolemy a decree was issued to the neighboring Greek cities, that they should adopt the same policy toward the Jews and make them partake of the sacrifices,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.9">and should slay those who did not choose to change over to Greek customs. One could see, therefore, the misery that had come upon them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.10">For example, two women were brought in for having circumcised their children. These women they publicly paraded about the city, with their babies hung at their breasts, then hurled them down headlong from the wall.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.11">Others who had assembled in the caves near by, to observe the seventh day secretly, were betrayed to Philip and were all burned together, because their piety kept them from defending themselves, in view of their regard for that most holy day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.12">Now I urge those who read this book not to be depressed by such calamities, but to recognize that these punishments were designed not to destroy but to discipline our people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.13">In fact, not to let the impious alone for long, but to punish them immediately, is a sign of great kindness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.14">For in the case of the other nations the Lord waits patiently to punish them until they have reached the full measure of their sins; but he does not deal in this way with us,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.15">in order that he may not take vengeance on us afterward when our sins have reached their height.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.16">Therefore he never withdraws his mercy from us. Though he disciplines us with calamities, he does not forsake his own people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.17">Let what we have said serve as a reminder; we must go on briefly with the story.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.18">Eleazar, one of the scribes in high position, a man now advanced in age and of noble presence, was being forced to open his mouth to eat swine's flesh.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.19">But he, welcoming death with honor rather than life with pollution, went up to the the rack of his own accord, spitting out the flesh,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.20">as men ought to go who have the courage to refuse things that it is not right to taste, even for the natural love of life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.21">Those who were in charge of that unlawful sacrifice took the man aside, because of their long acquaintance with him, and privately urged him to bring meat of his own providing, proper for him to use, and pretend that he was eating the flesh of the sacrificial meal which had been commanded by the king,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.22">so that by doing this he might be saved from death, and be treated kindly on account of his old friendship with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.23">But making a high resolve, worthy of his years and the dignity of his old age and the gray hairs which he had reached with distinction and his excellent life even from childhood, and moreover according to the holy God-given law, he declared himself quickly, telling them to send him to Hades.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.24">"Such pretense is not worthy of our time of life," he said, "lest many of the young should suppose that Eleazar in his ninetieth year has gone over to an alien religion,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.25">and through my pretense, for the sake of living a brief moment longer, they should be led astray because of me, while I defile and disgrace my old age.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.26">For even if for the present I should avoid the punishment of men, yet whether I live or die I shall not escape the hands of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.27">Therefore, by manfully giving up my life now, I will show myself worthy of my old age</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.28">and leave to the young a noble example of how to die a good death willingly and nobly for the revered and holy laws." When he had said this, he went at once to the rack.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.29">And those who a little before had acted toward him with good will now changed to ill will, because the words he had uttered were in their opinion sheer madness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.30">When he was about to die under the blows, he groaned aloud and said: "It is clear to the Lord in his holy knowledge that, though I might have been saved from death, I am enduring terrible sufferings in my body under this beating, but in my soul I am glad to suffer these things because I fear him."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.6.31">So in this way he died, leaving in his death an example of nobility and a memorial of courage, not only to the young but to the great body of his nation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Macc.7" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.1">It happened also that seven brothers and their mother were arrested and were being compelled by the king, under torture with whips and cords, to partake of unlawful swine's flesh.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.2">One of them, acting as their spokesman, said, "What do you intend to ask and learn from us? For we are ready to die rather than transgress the laws of our fathers."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.3">The king fell into a rage, and gave orders that pans and caldrons be heated.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.4">These were heated immediately, and he commanded that the tongue of their spokesman be cut out and that they scalp him and cut off his hands and feet, while the rest of the brothers and the mother looked on.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.5">When he was utterly helpless, the king ordered them to take him to the fire, still breathing, and to fry him in a pan. The smoke from the pan spread widely, but the brothers and their mother encouraged one another to die nobly, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.6">"The Lord God is watching over us and in truth has compassion on us, as Moses declared in his song which bore witness against the people to their faces, when he said, `And he will have compassion on his servants.'"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.7">After the first brother had died in this way, they brought forward the second for their sport. They tore off the skin of his head with the hair, and asked him, "Will you eat rather than have your body punished limb by limb?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.8">He replied in the language of his fathers, and said to them, "No." Therefore he in turn underwent tortures as the first brother had done.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.9">And when he was at his last breath, he said, "You accursed wretch, you dismiss us from this present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life, because we have died for his laws."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.10">After him, the third was the victim of their sport. When it was demanded, he quickly put out his tongue and courageously stretched forth his hands,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.11">and said nobly, "I got these from Heaven, and because of his laws I disdain them, and from him I hope to get them back again."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.12">As a result the king himself and those with him were astonished at the young man's spirit, for he regarded his sufferings as nothing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.13">When he too had died, they maltreated and tortured the fourth in the same way.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.14">And when he was near death, he said, "One cannot but choose to die at the hands of men and to cherish the hope that God gives of being raised again by him. But for you there will be no resurrection to life!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.15">Next they brought forward the fifth and maltreated him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.16">But he looked at the king, and said, "Because you have authority among men, mortal though you are, you do what you please. But do not think that God has forsaken our people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.17">Keep on, and see how his mighty power will torture you and your descendants!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.18">After him they brought forward the sixth. And when he was about to die, he said, "Do not deceive yourself in vain. For we are suffering these things on our own account, because of our sins against our own God. Therefore astounding things have happened.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.19">But do not think that you will go unpunished for having tried to fight against God!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.20">The mother was especially admirable and worthy of honorable memory. Though she saw her seven sons perish within a single day, she bore it with good courage because of her hope in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.21">She encouraged each of them in the language of their fathers. Filled with a noble spirit, she fired her woman's reasoning with a man's courage, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.22">"I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within each of you.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.23">Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.24">Antiochus felt that he was being treated with contempt, and he was suspicious of her reproachful tone. The youngest brother being still alive, Antiochus not only appealed to him in words, but promised with oaths that he would make him rich and enviable if he would turn from the ways of his fathers, and that he would take him for his friend and entrust him with public affairs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.25">Since the young man would not listen to him at all, the king called the mother to him and urged her to advise the youth to save himself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.26">After much urging on his part, she undertook to persuade her son.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.27">But, leaning close to him, she spoke in their native tongue as follows, deriding the cruel tyrant: "My son, have pity on me. I carried you nine months in my womb, and nursed you for three years, and have reared you and brought you up to this point in your life, and have taken care of you.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.28">I beseech you, my child, to look at the heaven and the earth and see everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make them out of things that existed. Thus also mankind comes into being.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.29">Do not fear this butcher, but prove worthy of your brothers. Accept death, so that in God's mercy I may get you back again with your brothers."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.30">While she was still speaking, the young man said, "What are you waiting for? I will not obey the king's command, but I obey the command of the law that was given to our fathers through Moses.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.31">But you, who have contrived all sorts of evil against the Hebrews, will certainly not escape the hands of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.32">For we are suffering because of our own sins.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.33">And if our living Lord is angry for a little while, to rebuke and discipline us, he will again be reconciled with his own servants.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.34">But you, unholy wretch, you most defiled of all men, do not be elated in vain and puffed up by uncertain hopes, when you raise your hand against the children of heaven.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.35">You have not yet escaped the judgment of the almighty, all-seeing God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.36">For our brothers after enduring a brief suffering have drunk of everflowing life under God's covenant; but you, by the judgment of God, will receive just punishment for your arrogance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.37">I, like my brothers, give up body and life for the laws of our fathers, appealing to God to show mercy soon to our nation and by afflictions and plagues to make you confess that he alone is God,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.38">and through me and my brothers to bring to an end the wrath of the Almighty which has justly fallen on our whole nation."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.39">The king fell into a rage, and handled him worse than the others, being exasperated at his scorn.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.40">So he died in his integrity, putting his whole trust in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.7.41">Last of all, the mother died, after her sons.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Macc.8" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.1">But Judas, who was also called Maccabeus, and his companions secretly entered the villages and summoned their kinsmen and enlisted those who had continued in the Jewish faith, and so they gathered about six thousand men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.2">They besought the Lord to look upon the people who were oppressed by all, and to have pity on the temple which had been profaned by ungodly men,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.3">and to have mercy on the city which was being destroyed and about to be leveled to the ground, and to hearken to the blood that cried out to him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.4">and to remember also the lawless destruction of the innocent babies and the blasphemies committed against his name, and to show his hatred of evil.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.5">As soon as Maccabeus got his army organized, the Gentiles could not withstand him, for the wrath of the Lord had turned to mercy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.6">Coming without warning, he would set fire to towns and villages. He captured strategic positions and put to flight not a few of the enemy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.7">He found the nights most advantageous for such attacks. And talk of his valor spread everywhere.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.8">When Philip saw that the man was gaining ground little by little, and that he was pushing ahead with more frequent successes, he wrote to Ptolemy, the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, for aid to the king's government.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.9">And Ptolemy promptly appointed Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one of the king's chief friends, and sent him, in command of no fewer than twenty thousand Gentiles of all nations, to wipe out the whole race of Judea. He associated with him Gorgias, a general and a man of experience in military service.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.10">Nicanor determined to make up for the king the tribute due to the Romans, two thousand talents, by selling the captured Jews into slavery.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.11">And he immediately sent to the cities on the seacoast, inviting them to buy Jewish slaves and promising to hand over ninety slaves for a talent, not expecting the judgment from the Almighty that was about to overtake him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.12">Word came to Judas concerning Nicanor's invasion; and when he told his companions of the arrival of the army,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.13">those who were cowardly and distrustful of God's justice ran off and got away.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.14">Others sold all their remaining property, and at the same time besought the Lord to rescue those who had been sold by the ungodly Nicanor before he ever met them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.15">if not for their own sake, yet for the sake of the covenants made with their fathers, and because he had called them by his holy and glorious name.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.16">But Maccabeus gathered his men together, to the number six thousand, and exhorted them not to be frightened by the enemy and not to fear the great multitude of Gentiles who were wickedly coming against them, but to fight nobly,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.17">keeping before their eyes the lawless outrage which the Gentiles had committed against the holy place, and the torture of the derided city, and besides, the overthrow of their ancestral way of life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.18">"For they trust to arms and acts of daring," he said, "but we trust in the Almighty God, who is able with a single nod to strike down those who are coming against us and even the whole world."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.19">Moreover, he told them of the times when help came to their ancestors; both the time of Sennacherib, when one hundred and eighty-five thousand perished,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.20">and the time of the battle with the Galatians that took place in Babylonia, when eight thousand in all went into the affair, with four thousand Macedonians; and when the Macedonians were hard pressed, the eight thousand, by the help that came to them from heaven, destroyed one hundred and twenty thousand and took much booty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.21">With these words he filled them with good courage and made them ready to die for their laws and their country; then he divided his army into four parts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.22">He appointed his brothers also, Simon and Joseph and Jonathan, each to command a division, putting fifteen hundred men under each.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.23">Besides, he appointed Eleazar to read aloud from the holy book, and gave the watchword, "God's help"; then, leading the first division himself, he joined battle with Nicanor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.24">With the Almighty as their ally, they slew more than nine thousand of the enemy, and wounded and disabled most of Nicanor's army, and forced them all to flee.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.25">They captured the money of those who had come to buy them as slaves. After pursuing them for some distance, they were obliged to return because the hour was late.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.26">For it was the day before the sabbath, and for that reason they did not continue their pursuit.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.27">And when they had collected the arms of the enemy and stripped them of their spoils, they kept the sabbath, giving great praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved them for that day and allotted it to them as the beginning of mercy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.28">After the sabbath they gave some of the spoils to those who had been tortured and to the widows and orphans, and distributed the rest among themselves and their children.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.29">When they had done this, they made common supplication and besought the merciful Lord to be wholly reconciled with his servants.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.30">In encounters with the forces of Timothy and Bacchides they killed more than twenty thousand of them and got possession of some exceedingly high strongholds, and they divided very much plunder, giving to those who had been tortured and to the orphans and widows, and also to the aged, shares equal to their own.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.31">Collecting the arms of the enemy, they stored them all carefully in strategic places, and carried the rest of the spoils to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.32">They killed the commander of Timothy's forces, a most unholy man, and one who had greatly troubled the Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.33">While they were celebrating the victory in the city of their fathers, they burned those who had set fire to the sacred gates, Callisthenes and some others, who had fled into one little house; so these received the proper recompense for their impiety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.34">The thrice-accursed Nicanor, who had brought the thousand merchants to buy the Jews,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.35">having been humbled with the help of the Lord by opponents whom he regarded as of the least account, took off his splendid uniform and made his way alone like a runaway slave across the country till he reached Antioch, having succeeded chiefly in the destruction of his own army!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.8.36">Thus he who had undertaken to secure tribute for the Romans by the capture of the people of Jerusalem proclaimed that the Jews had a Defender, and that therefore the Jews were invulnerable, because they followed the laws ordained by him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Macc.9" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.1">About that time, as it happened, Antiochus had retreated in disorder from the region of Persia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.2">For he had entered the city called Persepolis, and attempted to rob the temples and control the city. Therefore the people rushed to the rescue with arms, and Antiochus and his men were defeated, with the result that Antiochus was put to flight by the inhabitants and beat a shameful retreat.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.3">While he was in Ecbatana, news came to him of what had happened to Nicanor and the forces of Timothy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.4">Transported with rage, he conceived the idea of turning upon the Jews the injury done by those who had put him to flight; so he ordered his charioteer to drive without stopping until he completed the journey. But the judgment of heaven rode with him! For in his arrogance he said, "When I get there I will make Jerusalem a cemetery of Jews."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.5">But the all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him an incurable and unseen blow. As soon as he ceased speaking he was seized with a pain in his bowels for which there was no relief and with sharp internal tortures --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.6">and that very justly, for he had tortured the bowels of others with many and strange inflictions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.7">Yet he did not in any way stop his insolence, but was even more filled with arrogance, breathing fire in his rage against the Jews, and giving orders to hasten the journey. And so it came about that he fell out of his chariot as it was rushing along, and the fall was so hard as to torture every limb of his body.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.8">Thus he who had just been thinking that he could command the waves of the sea, in his superhuman arrogance, and imagining that he could weigh the high mountains in a balance, was brought down to earth and carried in a litter, making the power of God manifest to all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.9">And so the ungodly man's body swarmed with worms, and while he was still living in anguish and pain, his flesh rotted away, and because of his stench the whole army felt revulsion at his decay.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.10">Because of his intolerable stench no one was able to carry the man who a little while before had thought that he could touch the stars of heaven.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.11">Then it was that, broken in spirit, he began to lose much of his arrogance and to come to his senses under the scourge of God, for he was tortured with pain every moment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.12">And when he could not endure his own stench, he uttered these words: "It is right to be subject to God, and no mortal should think that he is equal to God."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.13">Then the abominable fellow made a vow to the Lord, who would no longer have mercy on him, stating</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.14">that the holy city, which he was hastening to level to the ground and to make a cemetery, he was now declaring to be free;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.15">and the Jews, whom he had not considered worth burying but had planned to throw out with their children to the beasts, for the birds to pick, he would make, all of them, equal to citizens of Athens;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.16">and the holy sanctuary, which he had formerly plundered, he would adorn with the finest offerings; and the holy vessels he would give back, all of them, many times over; and the expenses incurred for the sacrifices he would provide from his own revenues;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.17">and in addition to all this he also would become a Jew and would visit every inhabited place to proclaim the power of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.18">But when his sufferings did not in any way abate, for the judgment of God had justly come upon him, he gave up all hope for himself and wrote to the Jews the following letter, in the form of a supplication. This was its content:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.19">"To his worthy Jewish citizens, Antiochus their king and general sends hearty greetings and good wishes for their health and prosperity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.20">If you and your children are well and your affairs are as you wish, I am glad. As my hope is in heaven,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.21">I remember with affection your esteem and good will. On my way back from the region of Persia I suffered an annoying illness, and I have deemed it necessary to take thought for the general security of all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.22">I do not despair of my condition, for I have good hope of recovering from my illness,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.23">but I observed that my father, on the occasions when he made expeditions into the upper country, appointed his successor,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.24">so that, if anything unexpected happened or any unwelcome news came, the people throughout the realm would not be troubled, for they would know to whom the government was left.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.25">Moreover, I understand how the princes along the borders and the neighbors to my kingdom keep watching for opportunities and waiting to see what will happen. So I have appointed my son Antiochus to be king, whom I have often entrusted and commended to most of you when I hastened off to the upper provinces; and I have written to him what is written here.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.26">I therefore urge and beseech you to remember the public and private services rendered to you and to maintain your present good will, each of you, toward me and my son.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.27">For I am sure that he will follow my policy and will treat you with moderation and kindness."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.28">So the murderer and blasphemer, having endured the more intense suffering, such as he had inflicted on others, came to the end of his life by a most pitiable fate, among the mountains in a strange land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.9.29">And Philip, one of his courtiers, took his body home; then, fearing the son of Antiochus, he betook himself to Ptolemy Philometor in Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Macc.10" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.1">Now Maccabeus and his followers, the Lord leading them on, recovered the temple and the city;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.2">and they tore down the altars which had been built in the public square by the foreigners, and also destroyed the sacred precincts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.3">They purified the sanctuary, and made another altar of sacrifice; then, striking fire out of flint, they offered sacrifices, after a lapse of two years, and they burned incense and lighted lamps and set out the bread of the Presence.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.4">And when they had done this, they fell prostrate and besought the Lord that they might never again fall into such misfortunes, but that, if they should ever sin, they might be disciplined by him with forbearance and not be handed over to blasphemous and barbarous nations.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.5">It happened that on the same day on which the sanctuary had been profaned by the foreigners, the purification of the sanctuary took place, that is, on the twenty-fifth day of the same month, which was Chislev.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.6">And they celebrated it for eight days with rejoicing, in the manner of the feast of booths, remembering how not long before, during the feast of booths, they had been wandering in the mountains and caves like wild animals.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.7">Therefore bearing ivy-wreathed wands and beautiful branches and also fronds of palm, they offered hymns of thanksgiving to him who had given success to the purifying of his own holy place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.8">They decreed by public ordinance and vote that the whole nation of the Jews should observe these days every year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.9">Such then was the end of Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.10">Now we will tell what took place under Antiochus Eupator, who was the son of that ungodly man, and will give a brief summary of the principal calamities of the wars.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.11">This man, when he succeeded to the kingdom, appointed one Lysias to have charge of the government and to be chief governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.12">Ptolemy, who was called Macron, took the lead in showing justice to the Jews because of the wrong that had been done to them, and attempted to maintain peaceful relations with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.13">As a result he was accused before Eupator by the king's friends. He heard himself called a traitor at every turn, because he had abandoned Cyprus, which Philometor had entrusted to him, and had gone over to Antiochus Epiphanes. Unable to command the respect due his office, he took poison and ended his life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.14">When Gorgias became governor of the region, he maintained a force of mercenaries, and at every turn kept on warring against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.15">Besides this, the Idumeans, who had control of important strongholds, were harassing the Jews; they received those who were banished from Jerusalem, and endeavored to keep up the war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.16">But Maccabeus and his men, after making solemn supplication and beseeching God to fight on their side, rushed to the strongholds of the Idumeans.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.17">Attacking them vigorously, they gained possession of the places, and beat off all who fought upon the wall, and slew those whom they encountered, killing no fewer than twenty thousand.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.18">When no less than nine thousand took refuge in two very strong towers well equipped to withstand a siege,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.19">Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, and also Zacchaeus and his men, a force sufficient to besiege them; and he himself set off for places where he was more urgently needed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.20">But the men with Simon, who were money-hungry, were bribed by some of those who were in the towers, and on receiving seventy thousand drachmas let some of them slip away.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.21">When word of what had happened came to Maccabeus, he gathered the leaders of the people, and accused these men of having sold their brethren for money by setting their enemies free to fight against them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.22">Then he slew these men who had turned traitor, and immediately captured the two towers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.23">Having success at arms in everything he undertook, he destroyed more than twenty thousand in the two strongholds.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.24">Now Timothy, who had been defeated by the Jews before, gathered a tremendous force of mercenaries and collected the cavalry from Asia in no small number. He came on, intending to take Judea by storm.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.25">As he drew near, Maccabeus and his men sprinkled dust upon their heads and girded their loins with sackcloth, in supplication to God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.26">Falling upon the steps before the altar, they besought him to be gracious to them and to be an enemy to their enemies and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law declares.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.27">And rising from their prayer they took up their arms and advanced a considerable distance from the city; and when they came near to the enemy they halted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.28">Just as dawn was breaking, the two armies joined battle, the one having as pledge of success and victory not only their valor but their reliance upon the Lord, while the other made rage their leader in the fight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.29">When the battle became fierce, there appeared to the enemy from heaven five resplendent men on horses with golden bridles, and they were leading the Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.30">Surrounding Maccabeus and protecting him with their own armor and weapons, they kept him from being wounded. And they showered arrows and thunderbolts upon the enemy, so that, confused and blinded, they were thrown into disorder and cut to pieces.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.31">Twenty thousand five hundred were slaughtered, besides six hundred horsemen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.32">Timothy himself fled to a stronghold called Gazara, especially well garrisoned, where Chaereas was commander.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.33">Then Maccabeus and his men were glad, and they besieged the fort for four days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.34">The men within, relying on the strength of the place, blasphemed terribly and hurled out wicked words.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.35">But at dawn of the fifth day, twenty young men in the army of Maccabeus, fired with anger because of the blasphemies, bravely stormed the wall and with savage fury cut down every one they met.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.36">Others who came up in the same way wheeled around against the defenders and set fire to the towers; they kindled fires and burned the blasphemers alive. Others broke open the gates and let in the rest of the force, and they occupied the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.37">They killed Timothy, who was hidden in a cistern, and his brother Chaereas, and Apollophanes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.10.38">When they had accomplished these things, with hymns and thanksgivings they blessed the Lord who shows great kindness to Israel and gives them the victory.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.1">Very soon after this, Lysias, the king's guardian and kinsman, who was in charge of the government, being vexed at what had happened,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.2">gathered about eighty thousand men and all his cavalry and came against the Jews. He intended to make the city a home for Greeks,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.3">and to levy tribute on the temple as he did on the sacred places of the other nations, and to put up the high priesthood for sale every year.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.4">He took no account whatever of the power of God, but was elated with his ten thousands of infantry, and his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.5">Invading Judea, he approached Beth-zur, which was a fortified place about five leagues from Jerusalem, and pressed it hard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.6">When Maccabeus and his men got word that Lysias was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people, with lamentations and tears, besought the Lord to send a good angel to save Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.7">Maccabeus himself was the first to take up arms, and he urged the others to risk their lives with him to aid their brethren. Then they eagerly rushed off together.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.8">And there, while they were still near Jerusalem, a horseman appeared at their head, clothed in white and brandishing weapons of gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.9">And they all together praised the merciful God, and were strengthened in heart, ready to assail not only men but the wildest beasts or walls of iron.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.10">They advanced in battle order, having their heavenly ally, for the Lord had mercy on them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.11">They hurled themselves like lions against the enemy, and slew eleven thousand of them and sixteen hundred horsemen, and forced all the rest to flee.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.12">Most of them got away stripped and wounded, and Lysias himself escaped by disgraceful flight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.13">And as he was not without intelligence, he pondered over the defeat which had befallen him, and realized that the Hebrews were invincible because the mighty God fought on their side. So he sent to them</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.14">and persuaded them to settle everything on just terms, promising that he would persuade the king, constraining him to be their friend.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.15">Maccabeus, having regard for the common good, agreed to all that Lysias urged. For the king granted every request in behalf of the Jews which Maccabeus delivered to Lysias in writing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.16">The letter written to the Jews by Lysias was to this effect: "Lysias to the people of the Jews, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.17">John and Absalom, who were sent by you, have delivered your signed communication and have asked about the matters indicated therein.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.18">I have informed the king of everything that needed to be brought before him, and he has agreed to what was possible.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.19">If you will maintain your good will toward the government, I will endeavor for the future to help promote your welfare.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.20">And concerning these matters and their details, I have ordered these men and my representatives to confer with you.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.22">The king's letter ran thus: "King Antiochus to his brother Lysias, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.23">Now that our father has gone on to the gods, we desire that the subjects of the kingdom be undisturbed in caring for their own affairs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.24">We have heard that the Jews do not consent to our father's change to Greek customs but prefer their own way of living and ask that their own customs be allowed them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.25">Accordingly, since we choose that this nation also be free from disturbance, our decision is that their temple be restored to them and that they live according to the customs of their ancestors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.26">You will do well, therefore, to send word to them and give them pledges of friendship, so that they may know our policy and be of good cheer and go on happily in the conduct of their own affairs."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.27">To the nation the king's letter was as follows: "King Antiochus to the senate of the Jews and to the other Jews, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.28">If you are well, it is as we desire. We also are in good health.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.29">Menelaus has informed us that you wish to return home and look after your own affairs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.30">Therefore those who go home by the thirtieth day of Xanthicus will have our pledge of friendship and full permission</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.33">Farewell. The one hundred and forty-eighth year, Xanthicus fifteenth."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.34">The Romans also sent them a letter, which read thus: "Quintus Memmius and Titus Manius, envoys of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, greeting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.11.35">With regard to what Lysias the kinsman of the king has granted you, we also give consent.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.1">When this agreement had been reached, Lysias returned to the king, and the Jews went about their farming.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.2">But some of the governors in various places, Timothy and Apollonius the son of Gennaeus, as well as Hieronymus and Demophon, and in addition to these Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not let them live quietly and in peace.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.3">And some men of Joppa did so ungodly a deed as this: they invited the Jews who lived among them to embark, with their wives and children, on boats which they had provided, as though there were no ill will to the Jews;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.4">and this was done by public vote of the city. And when they accepted, because they wished to live peaceably and suspected nothing, the men of Joppa took them out to sea and drowned them, not less than two hundred.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.5">When Judas heard of the cruelty visited on his countrymen, he gave orders to his men</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.6">and, calling upon God the righteous Judge, attacked the murderers of his brethren. He set fire to the harbor by night, and burned the boats, and massacred those who had taken refuge there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.7">Then, because the city's gates were closed, he withdrew, intending to come again and root out the whole community of Joppa.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.8">But learning that the men in Jamnia meant in the same way to wipe out the Jews who were living among them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.9">he attacked the people of Jamnia by night and set fire to the harbor and the fleet, so that the glow of the light was seen in Jerusalem, thirty miles distant.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.10">When they had gone more than a mile from there, on their march against Timothy, not less than five thousand Arabs with five hundred horsemen attacked them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.11">After a hard fight Judas and his men won the victory, by the help of God. The defeated nomads besought Judas to grant them pledges of friendship, promising to give him cattle and to help his people in all other ways.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.12">Judas, thinking that they might really be useful in many ways, agreed to make peace with them; and after receiving his pledges they departed to their tents.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.13">He also attacked a certain city which was strongly fortified with earthworks and walls, and inhabited by all sorts of Gentiles. Its name was Caspin.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.14">And those who were within, relying on the strength of the walls and on their supply of provisions, behaved most insolently toward Judas and his men, railing at them and even blaspheming and saying unholy things.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.15">But Judas and his men, calling upon the great Sovereign of the world, who without battering-rams or engines of war overthrew Jericho in the days of Joshua, rushed furiously upon the walls.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.16">They took the city by the will of God, and slaughtered untold numbers, so that the adjoining lake, a quarter of a mile wide, appeared to be running over with blood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.17">When they had gone ninety-five miles from there, they came to Charax, to the Jews who are called Toubiani.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.18">They did not find Timothy in that region, for he had by then departed from the region without accomplishing anything, though in one place he had left a very strong garrison.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.19">Dositheus and Sosipater, who were captains under Maccabeus, marched out and destroyed those whom Timothy had left in the stronghold, more than ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.20">But Maccabeus arranged his army in divisions, set men in command of the divisions, and hastened after Timothy, who had with him a hundred and twenty thousand infantry and two thousand five hundred cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.21">When Timothy learned of the approach of Judas, he sent off the women and the children and also the baggage to a place called Carnaim; for that place was hard to besiege and difficult of access because of the narrowness of all the approaches.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.22">But when Judas' first division appeared, terror and fear came over the enemy at the manifestation to them of him who sees all things; and they rushed off in flight and were swept on, this way and that, so that often they were injured by their own men and pierced by the points of their swords.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.23">And Judas pressed the pursuit with the utmost vigor, putting the sinners to the sword, and destroyed as many as thirty thousand men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.24">Timothy himself fell into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater and their men. With great guile he besought them to let him go in safety, because he held the parents of most of them and the brothers of some and no consideration would be shown them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.25">And when with many words he had confirmed his solemn promise to restore them unharmed, they let him go, for the sake of saving their brethren.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.26">Then Judas marched against Carnaim and the temple of Atargatis, and slaughtered twenty-five thousand people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.27">After the rout and destruction of these, he marched also against Ephron, a fortified city where Lysias dwelt with multitudes of people of all nationalities. Stalwart young men took their stand before the walls and made a vigorous defense; and great stores of war engines and missiles were there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.28">But the Jews called upon the Sovereign who with power shatters the might of his enemies, and they got the city into their hands, and killed as many as twenty-five thousand of those who were within it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.29">Setting out from there, they hastened to Scythopolis, which is seventy-five miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.30">But when the Jews who dwelt there bore witness to the good will which the people of Scythopolis had shown them and their kind treatment of them in times of misfortune,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.31">they thanked them and exhorted them to be well disposed to their race in the future also. Then they went up to Jerusalem, as the feast of weeks was close at hand.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.32">After the feast called Pentecost, they hastened against Gorgias, the governor of Idumea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.33">And he came out with three thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.34">When they joined battle, it happened that a few of the Jews fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.35">But a certain Dositheus, one of Bacenor's men, who was on horseback and was a strong man, caught hold of Gorgias, and grasping his cloak was dragging him off by main strength, wishing to take the accursed man alive, when one of the Thracian horsemen bore down upon him and cut off his arm; so Gorgias escaped and reached Marisa.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.36">As Esdris and his men had been fighting for a long time and were weary, Judas called upon the Lord to show himself their ally and leader in the battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.37">In the language of their fathers he raised the battle cry, with hymns; then he charged against Gorgias' men when they were not expecting it, and put them to flight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.38">Then Judas assembled his army and went to the city of Adullam. As the seventh day was coming on, they purified themselves according to the custom, and they kept the sabbath there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.39">On the next day, as by that time it had become necessary, Judas and his men went to take up the bodies of the fallen and to bring them back to lie with their kinsmen in the sepulchres of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.40">Then under the tunic of every one of the dead they found sacred tokens of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. And it became clear to all that this was why these men had fallen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.41">So they all blessed the ways of the Lord, the righteous Judge, who reveals the things that are hidden;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.42">and they turned to prayer, beseeching that the sin which had been committed might be wholly blotted out. And the noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what had happened because of the sin of those who had fallen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.43">He also took up a collection, man by man, to the amount of two thousand drachmas of silver, and sent it to Jerusalem to provide for a sin offering. In doing this he acted very well and honorably, taking account of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.44">For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.12.45">But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is laid up for those who fall asleep in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. Therefore he made atonement for the dead, that they might be delivered from their sin.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="2Macc.13" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.1">In the one hundred and forty-ninth year word came to Judas and his men that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a great army against Judea,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.2">and with him Lysias, his guardian, who had charge of the government. Each of them had a Greek force of one hundred and ten thousand infantry, five thousand three hundred cavalry, twenty-two elephants, and three hundred chariots armed with scythes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.3">Menelaus also joined them and with utter hypocrisy urged Antiochus on, not for the sake of his country's welfare, but because he thought that he would be established in office.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.4">But the King of kings aroused the anger of Antiochus against the scoundrel; and when Lysias informed him that this man was to blame for all the trouble, he ordered them to take him to Beroea and to put him to death by the method which is the custom in that place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.5">For there is a tower in that place, fifty cubits high, full of ashes, and it has a rim running around it which on all sides inclines precipitously into the ashes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.6">There they all push to destruction any man guilty of sacrilege or notorious for other crimes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.7">By such a fate it came about that Menelaus the lawbreaker died, without even burial in the earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.8">And this was eminently just; because he had committed many sins against the altar whose fire and ashes were holy, he met his death in ashes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.9">The king with barbarous arrogance was coming to show the Jews things far worse than those that had been done in his father's time.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.10">But when Judas heard of this, he ordered the people to call upon the Lord day and night, now if ever to help those who were on the point of being deprived of the law and their country and the holy temple,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.11">and not to let the people who had just begun to revive fall into the hands of the blasphemous Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.12">When they had all joined in the same petition and had besought the merciful Lord with weeping and fasting and lying prostrate for three days without ceasing, Judas exhorted them and ordered them to stand ready.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.13">After consulting privately with the elders, he determined to march out and decide the matter by the help of God before the king's army could enter Judea and get possession of the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.14">So, committing the decision to the Creator of the world and exhorting his men to fight nobly to the death for the laws, temple, city, country, and commonwealth, he pitched his camp near Modein.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.15">He gave his men the watchword, "God's victory," and with a picked force of the bravest young men, he attacked the king's pavilion at night and slew as many as two thousand men in the camp. He stabbed the leading elephant and its rider.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.16">In the end they filled the camp with terror and confusion and withdrew in triumph.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.17">This happened, just as day was dawning, because the Lord's help protected him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.18">The king, having had a taste of the daring of the Jews, tried strategy in attacking their positions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.19">He advanced against Beth-zur, a strong fortress of the Jews, was turned back, attacked again, and was defeated.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.20">Judas sent in to the garrison whatever was necessary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.21">But Rhodocus, a man from the ranks of the Jews, gave secret information to the enemy; he was sought for, caught, and put in prison.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.22">The king negotiated a second time with the people in Beth-zur, gave pledges, received theirs, withdrew, attacked Judas and his men, was defeated;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.23">he got word that Philip, who had been left in charge of the government, had revolted in Antioch; he was dismayed, called in the Jews, yielded and swore to observe all their rights, settled with them and offered sacrifice, honored the sanctuary and showed generosity to the holy place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.24">He received Maccabeus, left Hegemonides as governor from Ptolemais to Gerar,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.25">and went to Ptolemais. The people of Ptolemais were indignant over the treaty; in fact they were so angry that they wanted to annul its terms.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.13.26">Lysias took the public platform, made the best possible defense, convinced them, appeased them, gained their good will, and set out for Antioch. This is how the king's attack and withdrawal turned out.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Macc.14" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.1">Three years later, word came to Judas and his men that Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, had sailed into the harbor of Tripolis with a strong army and a fleet,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.2">and had taken possession of the country, having made away with Antiochus and his guardian Lysias.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.3">Now a certain Alcimus, who had formerly been high priest but had wilfully defiled himself in the times of separation, realized that there was no way for him to be safe or to have access again to the holy altar,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.4">and went to King Demetrius in about the one hundred and fifty-first year, presenting to him a crown of gold and a palm, and besides these some of the customary olive branches from the temple. During that day he kept quiet.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.5">But he found an opportunity that furthered his mad purpose when he was invited by Demetrius to a meeting of the council and was asked about the disposition and intentions of the Jews. He answered:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.6">"Those of the Jews who are called Hasideans, whose leader is Judas Maccabeus, are keeping up war and stirring up sedition, and will not let the kingdom attain tranquillity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.7">Therefore I have laid aside my ancestral glory -- I mean the high priesthood -- and have now come here,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.8">first because I am genuinely concerned for the interests of the king, and second because I have regard also for my fellow citizens. For through the folly of those whom I have mentioned our whole nation is now in no small misfortune.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.9">Since you are acquainted, O king, with the details of this matter, deign to take thought for our country and our hard-pressed nation with the gracious kindness which you show to all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.10">For as long as Judas lives, it is impossible for the government to find peace."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.11">When he had said this, the rest of the king's friends, who were hostile to Judas, quickly inflamed Demetrius still more.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.12">And he immediately chose Nicanor, who had been in command of the elephants, appointed him governor of Judea, and sent him off</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.13">with orders to kill Judas and scatter his men, and to set up Alcimus as high priest of the greatest temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.14">And the Gentiles throughout Judea, who had fled before Judas, flocked to join Nicanor, thinking that the misfortunes and calamities of the Jews would mean prosperity for themselves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.15">When the Jews heard of Nicanor's coming and the gathering of the Gentiles, they sprinkled dust upon their heads and prayed to him who established his own people for ever and always upholds his own heritage by manifesting himself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.16">At the command of the leader, they set out from there immediately and engaged them in battle at a village called Dessau.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.17">Simon, the brother of Judas, had encountered Nicanor, but had been temporarily checked because of the sudden consternation created by the enemy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.18">Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the valor of Judas and his men and their courage in battle for their country, shrank from deciding the issue by bloodshed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.19">Therefore he sent Posidonius and Theodotus and Mattathias to give and receive pledges of friendship.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.20">When the terms had been fully considered, and the leader had informed the people, and it had appeared that they were of one mind, they agreed to the covenant.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.21">And the leaders set a day on which to meet by themselves. A chariot came forward from each army; seats of honor were set in place;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.22">Judas posted armed men in readiness at key places to prevent sudden treachery on the part of the enemy; they held the proper conference.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.23">Nicanor stayed on in Jerusalem and did nothing out of the way, but dismissed the flocks of people that had gathered.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.24">And he kept Judas always in his presence; he was warmly attached to the man.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.25">And he urged him to marry and have children; so he married, settled down, and shared the common life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.26">But when Alcimus noticed their good will for one another, he took the covenant that had been made and went to Demetrius. He told him that Nicanor was disloyal to the government, for he had appointed that conspirator against the kingdom, Judas, to be his successor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.27">The king became excited and, provoked by the false accusations of that depraved man, wrote to Nicanor, stating that he was displeased with the covenant and commanding him to send Maccabeus to Antioch as a prisoner without delay.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.28">When this message came to Nicanor, he was troubled and grieved that he had to annul their agreement when the man had done no wrong.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.29">Since it was not possible to oppose the king, he watched for an opportunity to accomplish this by a stratagem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.30">But Maccabeus, noticing that Nicanor was more austere in his dealings with him and was meeting him more rudely than had been his custom, concluded that this austerity did not spring from the best motives. So he gathered not a few of his men, and went into hiding from Nicanor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.31">When the latter became aware that he had been cleverly outwitted by the man, he went to the great and holy temple while the priests were offering the customary sacrifices, and commanded them to hand the man over.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.32">And when they declared on oath that they did not know where the man was whom he sought,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.33">he stretched out his right hand toward the sanctuary, and swore this oath: "If you do not hand Judas over to me as a prisoner, I will level this precinct of God to the ground and tear down the altar, and I will build here a splendid temple to Dionysus."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.34">Having said this, he went away. Then the priests stretched forth their hands toward heaven and called upon the constant Defender of our nation, in these words:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.35">"O Lord of all, who hast need of nothing, thou wast pleased that there be a temple for thy habitation among us;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.36">so now, O holy One, Lord of all holiness, keep undefiled for ever this house that has been so recently purified."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.37">A certain Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, was denounced to Nicanor as a man who loved his fellow citizens and was very well thought of and for his good will was called father of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.38">For in former times, when there was no mingling with the Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and for Judaism he had with all zeal risked body and life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.39">Nicanor, wishing to exhibit the enmity which he had for the Jews, sent more than five hundred soldiers to arrest him;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.40">for he thought that by arresting him he would do them an injury.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.41">When the troops were about to capture the tower and were forcing the door of the courtyard, they ordered that fire be brought and the doors burned. Being surrounded, Razis fell upon his own sword,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.42">preferring to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of sinners and suffer outrages unworthy of his noble birth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.43">But in the heat of the struggle he did not hit exactly, and the crowd was now rushing in through the doors. He bravely ran up on the wall, and manfully threw himself down into the crowd.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.44">But as they quickly drew back, a space opened and he fell in the middle of the empty space.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.45">Still alive and aflame with anger, he rose, and though his blood gushed forth and his wounds were severe he ran through the crowd; and standing upon a steep rock,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.14.46">with his blood now completely drained from him, he tore out his entrails, took them with both hands and hurled them at the crowd, calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to give them back to him again. This was the manner of his death.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="2Macc.15" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.1">When Nicanor heard that Judas and his men were in the region of Samaria, he made plans to attack them with complete safety on the day of rest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.2">And when the Jews who were compelled to follow him said, "Do not destroy so savagely and barbarously, but show respect for the day which he who sees all things has honored and hallowed above other days,"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.3">the thrice-accursed wretch asked if there were a sovereign in heaven who had commanded the keeping of the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.4">And when they declared, "It is the living Lord himself, the Sovereign in heaven, who ordered us to observe the seventh day,"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.5">he replied, "And I am a sovereign also, on earth, and I command you to take up arms and finish the king's business." Nevertheless, he did not succeed in carrying out his abominable design.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.6">This Nicanor in his utter boastfulness and arrogance had determined to erect a public monument of victory over Judas and his men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.7">But Maccabeus did not cease to trust with all confidence that he would get help from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.8">And he exhorted his men not to fear the attack of the Gentiles, but to keep in mind the former times when help had come to them from heaven, and now to look for the victory which the Almighty would give them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.9">Encouraging them from the law and the prophets, and reminding them also of the struggles they had won, he made them the more eager.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.10">And when he had aroused their courage, he gave his orders, at the same time pointing out the perfidy of the Gentiles and their violation of oaths.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.11">He armed each of them not so much with confidence in shields and spears as with the inspiration of brave words, and he cheered them all by relating a dream, a sort of vision, which was worthy of belief.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.12">What he saw was this: Onias, who had been high priest, a noble and good man, of modest bearing and gentle manner, one who spoke fittingly and had been trained from childhood in all that belongs to excellence, was praying with outstretched hands for the whole body of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.13">Then likewise a man appeared, distinguished by his gray hair and dignity, and of marvelous majesty and authority.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.14">And Onias spoke, saying, "This is a man who loves the brethren and prays much for the people and the holy city, Jeremiah, the prophet of God."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.15">Jeremiah stretched out his right hand and gave to Judas a golden sword, and as he gave it he addressed him thus:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.16">"Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with which you will strike down your adversaries."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.17">Encouraged by the words of Judas, so noble and so effective in arousing valor and awaking manliness in the souls of the young, they determined not to carry on a campaign but to attack bravely, and to decide the matter, by fighting hand to hand with all courage, because the city and the sanctuary and the temple were in danger.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.18">Their concern for wives and children, and also for brethren and relatives, lay upon them less heavily; their greatest and first fear was for the consecrated sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.19">And those who had to remain in the city were in no little distress, being anxious over the encounter in the open country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.20">When all were now looking forward to the coming decision, and the enemy was already close at hand with their army drawn up for battle, the elephants strategically stationed and the cavalry deployed on the flanks,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.21">Maccabeus, perceiving the hosts that were before him and the varied supply of arms and the savagery of the elephants, stretched out his hands toward heaven and called upon the Lord who works wonders; for he knew that it is not by arms, but as the Lord decides, that he gains the victory for those who deserve it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.22">And he called upon him in these words: "O Lord, thou didst send thy angel in the time of Hezekiah king of Judea, and he slew fully a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of Sennacherib.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.23">So now, O Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel to carry terror and trembling before us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.24">By the might of thy arm may these blasphemers who come against thy holy people be struck down." With these words he ended his prayer.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.25">Nicanor and his men advanced with trumpets and battle songs;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.26">and Judas and his men met the enemy in battle with invocation to God and prayers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.27">So, fighting with their hands and praying to God in their hearts, they laid low no less than thirty-five thousand men, and were greatly gladdened by God's manifestation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.28">When the action was over and they were returning with joy, they recognized Nicanor, lying dead, in full armor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.29">Then there was shouting and tumult, and they blessed the Sovereign Lord in the language of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.30">And the man who was ever in body and soul the defender of his fellow citizens, the man who maintained his youthful good will toward his countrymen, ordered them to cut off Nicanor's head and arm and carry them to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.31">And when he arrived there and had called his countrymen together and stationed the priests before the altar, he sent for those who were in the citadel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.32">He showed them the vile Nicanor's head and that profane man's arm, which had been boastfully stretched out against the holy house of the Almighty;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.33">and he cut out the tongue of the ungodly Nicanor and said that he would give it piecemeal to the birds and hang up these rewards of his folly opposite the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.34">And they all, looking to heaven, blessed the Lord who had manifested himself, saying, "Blessed is he who has kept his own place undefiled."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.35">And he hung Nicanor's head from the citadel, a clear and conspicuous sign to every one of the help of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.36">And they all decreed by public vote never to let this day go unobserved, but to celebrate the thirteenth day of the twelfth month -- which is called Adar in the Syrian language -- the day before Mordecai's day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.37">This, then, is how matters turned out with Nicanor. And from that time the city has been in the possession of the Hebrews. So I too will here end my story.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.38">If it is well told and to the point, that is what I myself desired; if it is poorly done and mediocre, that was the best I could do.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="2Macc.15.39">For just as it is harmful to drink wine alone, or, again, to drink water alone, while wine mixed with water is sweet and delicious and enhances one's enjoyment, so also the style of the story delights the ears of those who read the work. And here will be the end.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="3Macc.1" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.1">When Philopator learned from those who returned that the regions which he had controlled had been seized by Antiochus, he gave orders to all his forces, both infantry and cavalry, took with him his sister Arsinoe, and marched out to the region near Raphia, where Antiochus's supporters were encamped.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.2">But a certain Theodotus, determined to carry out the plot he had devised, took with him the best of the Ptolemaic arms that had been previously issued to him, and crossed over by night to the tent of Ptolemy, intending single-handed to kill him and thereby end the war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.3">But Dositheus, known as the son of Drimylus, a Jew by birth who later changed his religion and apostatized from the ancestral traditions, had led the king away and arranged that a certain insignificant man should sleep in the tent; and so it turned out that this man incurred the vengeance meant for the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.4">When a bitter fight resulted, and matters were turning out rather in favor of Antiochus, Arsinoe went to the troops with wailing and tears, her locks all disheveled, and exhorted them to defend themselves and their children and wives bravely, promising to give them each two minas of gold if they won the battle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.5">And so it came about that the enemy was routed in the action, and many captives also were taken.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.6">Now that he had foiled the plot, Ptolemy decided to visit the neighboring cities and encourage them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.7">By doing this, and by endowing their sacred enclosures with gifts, he strengthened the morale of his subjects.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.8">Since the Jews had sent some of their council and elders to greet him, to bring him gifts of welcome, and to congratulate him on what had happened, he was all the more eager to visit them as soon as possible.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.9">After he had arrived in Jerusalem, he offered sacrifice to the supreme God and made thank-offerings and did what was fitting for the holy place. Then, upon entering the place and being impressed by its excellence and its beauty,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.10">he marveled at the good order of the temple, and conceived a desire to enter the holy of holies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.11">When they said that this was not permitted, because not even members of their own nation were allowed to enter, nor even all of the priests, but only the high priest who was pre-eminent over all, and he only once a year, the king was by no means persuaded.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.12">Even after the law had been read to him, he did not cease to maintain that he ought to enter, saying, "Even if those men are deprived of this honor, I ought not to be."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.13">And he inquired why, when he entered every other temple, no one there had stopped him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.14">And someone heedlessly said that it was wrong to take this as a sign in itself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.15">"But since this has happened," the king said, "why should not I at least enter, whether they wish it or not?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.16">Then the priests in all their vestments prostrated themselves and entreated the supreme God to aid in the present situation and to avert the violence of this evil design, and they filled the temple with cries and tears;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.17">and those who remained behind in the city were agitated and hurried out, supposing that something mysterious was occurring.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.18">The virgins who had been enclosed in their chambers rushed out with their mothers, sprinkled their hair with dust, and filled the streets with groans and lamentations.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.19">Those women who had recently been arrayed for marriage abandoned the bridal chambers prepared for wedded union, and, neglecting proper modesty, in a disorderly rush flocked together in the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.20">Mothers and nurses abandoned even newborn children here and there, some in houses and some in the streets, and without a backward look they crowded together at the most high temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.21">Various were the supplications of those gathered there because of what the king was profanely plotting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.22">In addition, the bolder of the citizens would not tolerate the completion of his plans or the fulfillment of his intended purpose.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.23">They shouted to their fellows to take arms and die courageously for the ancestral law, and created a considerable disturbance in the holy place; and being barely restrained by the old men and the elders, they resorted to the same posture of supplication as the others.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.24">Meanwhile the crowd, as before, was engaged in prayer,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.25">while the elders near the king tried in various ways to change his arrogant mind from the plan that he had conceived.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.26">But he, in his arrogance, took heed of nothing, and began now to approach, determined to bring the aforesaid plan to a conclusion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.27">When those who were around him observed this, they turned, together with our people, to call upon him who has all power to defend them in the present trouble and not to overlook this unlawful and haughty deed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.28">The continuous, vehement, and concerted cry of the crowds resulted in an immense uproar;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.1.29">for it seemed that not only the men but also the walls and the whole earth around echoed, because indeed all at that time preferred death to the profanation of the place.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="3Macc.2" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.1">Then the high priest Simon, facing the sanctuary, bending his knees and extending his hands with calm dignity, prayed as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.2">"Lord, Lord, king of the heavens, and sovereign of all creation, holy among the holy ones, the only ruler, almighty, give attention to us who are suffering grievously from an impious and profane man, puffed up in his audacity and power.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.3">For you, the creator of all things and the governor of all, are a just Ruler, and you judge those who have done anything in insolence and arrogance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.4">You destroyed those who in the past committed injustice, among whom were even giants who trusted in their strength and boldness, whom you destroyed by bringing upon them a boundless flood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.5">You consumed with fire and sulphur the men of Sodom who acted arrogantly, who were notorious for their vices; and you made them an example to those who should come afterward.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.6">You made known your mighty power by inflicting many and varied punishments on the audacious Pharaoh who had enslaved your holy people Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.7">And when he pursued them with chariots and a mass of troops, you overwhelmed him in the depths of the sea, but carried through safely those who had put their confidence in you, the Ruler over the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.8">And when they had seen works of your hands, they praised you, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.9">You, O King, when you had created the boundless and immeasurable earth, chose this city and sanctified this place for your name, though you have no need of anything; and when you had glorified it by your magnificent manifestation, you made it a firm foundation for the glory of your great and honored name.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.10">And because you love the house of Israel, you promised that if we should have reverses, and tribulation should overtake us, you would listen to our petition when we come to this place and pray.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.11">And indeed you are faithful and true.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.12">And because oftentimes when our fathers were oppressed you helped them in their humiliation, and rescued them from great evils,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.13">see now, O holy King, that because of our many and great sins we are crushed with suffering, subjected to our enemies, and overtaken by helplessness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.14">In our downfall this audacious and profane man undertakes to violate the holy place on earth dedicated to your glorious name.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.15">For your dwelling, the heaven of heavens, is unapproachable by man.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.16">But because you graciously bestowed your glory upon your people Israel, you sanctified this place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.17">Do not punish us for the defilement committed by these men, or call us to account for this profanation, lest the transgressors boast in their wrath or exult in the arrogance of their tongue, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.18">`We have trampled down the house of the sanctuary as offensive houses are trampled down.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.19">Wipe away our sins and disperse our errors, and reveal your mercy at this hour.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.20">Speedily let your mercies overtake us, and put praises in the mouth of those who are downcast and broken in spirit, and give us peace."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.21">Thereupon God, who oversees all things, the first Father of all, holy among the holy ones, having heard the lawful supplication, scourged him who had exalted himself in insolence and audacity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.22">He shook him on this side and that as a reed is shaken by the wind, so that he lay helpless on the ground and, besides being paralyzed in his limbs, was unable even to speak, since he was smitten by a righteous judgment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.23">Then both friends and bodyguards, seeing the severe punishment that had overtaken him, and fearing lest he should lose his life, quickly dragged him out, panic-stricken in their exceedingly great fear.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.24">After a while he recovered, and though he had been punished, he by no means repented, but went away uttering bitter threats.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.25">When he arrived in Egypt, he increased in his deeds of malice, abetted by the previously mentioned drinking companions and comrades, who were strangers to everything just.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.26">He was not content with his uncounted licentious deeds, but he also continued with such audacity that he framed evil reports in the various localities; and many of his friends, intently observing the king's purpose, themselves also followed his will.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.27">He proposed to inflict public disgrace upon the Jewish community, and he set up a stone on the tower in the courtyard with this inscription:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.28">"None of those who do not sacrifice shall enter their sanctuaries, and all Jews shall be subjected to a registration involving poll tax and to the status of slaves. Those who object to this are to be taken by force and put to death;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.29">those who are registered are also to be branded on their bodies by fire with the ivy-leaf symbol of Dionysus, and they shall also be reduced to their former limited status."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.30">In order that he might not appear to be an enemy to all, he inscribed below: "But if any of them prefer to join those who have been initiated into the mysteries, they shall have equal citizenship with the Alexandrians."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.31">Now some, however, with an obvious abhorrence of the price to be exacted for maintaining the religion of their city, readily gave themselves up, since they expected to enhance their reputation by their future association with the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.32">But the majority acted firmly with a courageous spirit and did not depart from their religion; and by paying money in exchange for life they confidently attempted to save themselves from the registration.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.2.33">They remained resolutely hopeful of obtaining help, and they abhorred those who separated themselves from them, considering them to be enemies of the Jewish nation, and depriving them of common fellowship and mutual help.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="3Macc.3" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.1">When the impious king comprehended this situation, he became so infuriated that not only was he enraged against those Jews who lived in Alexandria, but was still more bitterly hostile toward those in the countryside; and he ordered that all should promptly be gathered into one place, and put to death by the most cruel means.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.2">While these matters were being arranged, a hostile rumor was circulated against the Jewish nation by men who conspired to do them ill, a pretext being given by a report that they hindered others from the observance of their customs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.3">The Jews, however, continued to maintain good will and unswerving loyalty toward the dynasty;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.4">but because they worshiped God and conducted themselves by his law, they kept their separateness with respect to foods. For this reason they appeared hateful to some;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.5">but since they adorned their style of life with the good deeds of upright people, they were established in good repute among all men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.6">Nevertheless those of other races paid no heed to their good service to their nation, which was common talk among all;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.7">instead they gossiped about the differences in worship and foods, alleging that these people were loyal neither to the king nor to his authorities, but were hostile and greatly opposed to his government. So they attached no ordinary reproach to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.8">The Greeks in the city, though wronged in no way, when they saw an unexpected tumult around these people and the crowds that suddenly were forming, were not strong enough to help them, for they lived under tyranny. They did try to console them, being grieved at the situation, and expected that matters would change;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.9">for such a great community ought not be left to its fate when it had committed no offense.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.10">And already some of their neighbors and friends and business associates had taken some of them aside privately and were pledging to protect them and to exert more earnest efforts for their assistance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.11">Then the king, boastful of his present good fortune, and not considering the might of the supreme God, but assuming that he would persevere constantly in his same purpose, wrote this letter against them:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.12">"King Ptolemy Philopator to his generals and soldiers in Egypt and all its districts, greetings and good health.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.13">I myself and our government are faring well.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.14">When our expedition took place in Asia, as you yourselves know, it was brought to conclusion, according to plan, by the gods' deliberate alliance with us in battle,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.15">and we considered that we should not rule the nations inhabiting Coele-Syria and Phoenicia by the power of the spear but should cherish them with clemency and great benevolence, gladly treating them well.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.16">And when we had granted very great revenues to the temples in the cities, we came on to Jerusalem also, and went up to honor the temple of those wicked people, who never cease from their folly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.17">They accepted our presence by word, but insincerely by deed, because when we proposed to enter their inner temple and honor it with magnificent and most beautiful offerings,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.18">they were carried away by their traditional conceit, and excluded us from entering; but they were spared the exercise of our power because of the benevolence which we have toward all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.19">By maintaining their manifest ill-will toward us, they become the only people among all nations who hold their heads high in defiance of kings and their own benefactors, and are unwilling to regard any action as sincere.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.20">"But we, when we arrived in Egypt victorious, accommodated ourselves to their folly and did as was proper, since we treat all nations with benevolence.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.21">Among other things, we made known to all our amnesty toward their compatriots here, both because of their alliance with us and the myriad affairs liberally entrusted to them from the beginning; and we ventured to make a change, by deciding both to deem them worthy of Alexandrian citizenship and to make them participants in our regular religious rites.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.22">But in their innate malice they took this in a contrary spirit, and disdained what is good. Since they incline constantly to evil,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.23">they not only spurn the priceless citizenship, but also both by speech and by silence they abominate those few among them who are sincerely disposed toward us; in every situation, in accordance with their infamous way of life, they secretly suspect that we may soon alter our policy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.24">Therefore, fully convinced by these indications that they are ill-disposed toward us in every way, we have taken precautions lest, if a sudden disorder should later arise against us, we should have these impious people behind our backs as traitors and barbarous enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.25">Therefore we have given orders that, as soon as this letter shall arrive, you are to send to us those who live among you, together with their wives and children, with insulting and harsh treatment, and bound securely with iron fetters, to suffer the sure and shameful death that befits enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.26">For when these all have been punished, we are sure that for the remaining time the government will be established for ourselves in good order and in the best state.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.27">But whoever shelters any of the Jews, old people or children or even infants, will be tortured to death with the most hateful torments, together with his family.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.28">Any one willing to give information will receive the property of the one who incurs the punishment, and also two thousand drachmas from the royal treasury, and will be awarded his freedom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.29">Every place detected sheltering a Jew is to be made unapproachable and burned with fire, and shall become useless for all time to any mortal creature."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.3.30">The letter was written in the above form.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="3Macc.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.1">In every place, then, where this decree arrived, a feast at public expense was arranged for the Gentiles with shouts and gladness, for the inveterate enmity which had long ago been in their minds was now made evident and outspoken.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.2">But among the Jews there was incessant mourning, lamentation, and tearful cries; everywhere their hearts were burning, and they groaned because of the unexpected destruction that had suddenly been decreed for them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.3">What district or city, or what habitable place at all, or what streets were not filled with mourning and wailing for them?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.4">For with such a harsh and ruthless spirit were they being sent off, all together, by the generals in the several cities, that at the sight of their unusual punishments, even some of their enemies, perceiving the common object of pity before their eyes, reflected upon the uncertainty of life and shed tears at the most miserable expulsion of these people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.5">For a multitude of gray-headed old men, sluggish and bent with age, was being led away, forced to march at a swift pace by the violence with which they were driven in such a shameful manner.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.6">And young women who had just entered the bridal chamber to share married life exchanged joy for wailing, their myrrh-perfumed hair sprinkled with ashes, and were carried away unveiled, all together raising a lament instead of a wedding song, as they were torn by the harsh treatment of the heathen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.7">In bonds and in public view they were violently dragged along as far as the place of embarkation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.8">Their husbands, in the prime of youth, their necks encircled with ropes instead of garlands, spent the remaining days of their marriage festival in lamentations instead of good cheer and youthful revelry, seeing death immediately before them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.9">They were brought on board like wild animals, driven under the constraint of iron bonds; some were fastened by the neck to the benches of the boats, others had their feet secured by unbreakable fetters,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.10">and in addition they were confined under a solid deck, so that with their eyes in total darkness, they should undergo treatment befitting traitors during the whole voyage.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.11">When these men had been brought to the place called Schedia, and the voyage was concluded as the king had decreed, he commanded that they should be enclosed in the hippodrome which had been built with a monstrous perimeter wall in front of the city, and which was well suited to make them an obvious spectacle to all coming back into the city and to those from the city going out into the country, so that they could neither communicate with the king's forces nor in any way claim to be inside the circuit of the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.12">And when this had happened, the king, hearing that the Jews' compatriots from the city frequently went out in secret to lament bitterly the ignoble misfortune of their brothers,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.13">ordered in his rage that these men be dealt with in precisely the same fashion as the others, not omitting any detail of their punishment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.14">The entire race was to be registered individually, not for the hard labor that has been briefly mentioned before, but to be tortured with the outrages that he had ordered, and at the end to be destroyed in the space of a single day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.15">The registration of these people was therefore conducted with bitter haste and zealous intentness from the rising of the sun till its setting, and though uncompleted it stopped after forty days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.16">The king was greatly and continually filled with joy, organizing feasts in honor of all his idols, with a mind alienated from truth and with a profane mouth, praising speechless things that are not able even to communicate or to come to one's help, and uttering improper words against the supreme God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.17">But after the previously mentioned interval of time the scribes declared to the king that they were no longer able to take the census of the Jews because of their innumerable multitude,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.18">although most of them were still in the country, some still residing in their homes, and some at the place; the task was impossible for all the generals in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.19">After he had threatened them severely, charging that they had been bribed to contrive a means of escape, he was clearly convinced about the matter</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.20">when they said and proved that both the paper and the pens they used for writing had already given out.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.4.21">But this was an act of the invincible providence of him who was aiding the Jews from heaven.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="3Macc.5" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.1">Then the king, completely inflexible, was filled with overpowering anger and wrath; so he summoned Hermon, keeper of the elephants,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.2">and ordered him on the following day to drug all the elephants -- five hundred in number -- with large handfuls of frankincense and plenty of unmixed wine, and to drive them in, maddened by the lavish abundance of liquor, so that the Jews might meet their doom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.3">When he had given these orders he returned to his feasting, together with those of his friends and of the army who were especially hostile toward the Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.4">And Hermon, keeper of the elephants, proceeded faithfully to carry out the orders.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.5">The servants in charge of the Jews went out in the evening and bound the hands of the wretched people and arranged for their continued custody through the night, convinced that the whole nation would experience its final destruction.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.6">For to the Gentiles it appeared that the Jews were left without any aid,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.7">because in their bonds they were forcibly confined on every side. But with tears and a voice hard to silence they all called upon the Almighty Lord and Ruler of all power, their merciful God and Father, praying</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.8">that he avert with vengeance the evil plot against them and in a glorious manifestation rescue them from the fate now prepared for them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.9">So their entreaty ascended fervently to heaven.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.10">Hermon, however, when he had drugged the pitiless elephants until they had been filled with a great abundance of wine and satiated with frankincense, presented himself at the courtyard early in the morning to report to the king about these preparations.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.11">But the Lord sent upon the king a portion of sleep, that beneficence which from the beginning, night and day, is bestowed by him who grants it to whomever he wishes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.12">And by the action of the Lord he was overcome by so pleasant and deep a sleep that he quite failed in his lawless purpose and was completely frustrated in his inflexible plan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.13">Then the Jews, since they had escaped the appointed hour, praised their holy God and again begged him who is easily reconciled to show the might of his all-powerful hand to the arrogant Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.14">But now, since it was nearly the middle of the tenth hour, the person who was in charge of the invitations, seeing that the guests were assembled, approached the king and nudged him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.15">And when he had with difficulty roused him, he pointed out that the hour of the banquet was already slipping by, and he gave him an account of the situation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.16">The king, after considering this, returned to his drinking, and ordered those present for the banquet to recline opposite him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.17">When this was done he urged them to give themselves over to revelry and to make the present portion of the banquet joyful by celebrating all the more.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.18">After the party had been going on for some time, the king summoned Hermon and with sharp threats demanded to know why the Jews had been allowed to remain alive through the present day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.19">But when he, with the corroboration of his friends, pointed out that while it was still night he had carried out completely the order given him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.20">the king, possessed by a savagery worse than that of Phalaris, said that the Jews were benefited by today's sleep, "but," he added, "tomorrow without delay prepare the elephants in the same way for the destruction of the lawless Jews!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.21">When the king had spoken, all those present readily and joyfully with one accord gave their approval, and each departed to his own home.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.22">But they did not so much employ the duration of the night in sleep as in devising all sorts of insults for those they thought to be doomed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.23">Then, as soon as the cock had crowed in the early morning, Hermon, having equipped the beasts, began to move them along in the great colonnade.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.24">The crowds of the city had been assembled for this most pitiful spectacle and they were eagerly waiting for daybreak.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.25">But the Jews, at their last gasp, since the time had run out, stretched their hands toward heaven and with most tearful supplication and mournful dirges implored the supreme God to help them again at once.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.26">The rays of the sun were not yet shed abroad, and while the king was receiving his friends, Hermon arrived and invited him to come out, indicating that what the king desired was ready for action.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.27">But he, upon receiving the report and being struck by the unusual invitation to come out -- since he had been completely overcome by incomprehension -- inquired what the matter was for which this had been so zealously completed for him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.28">This was the act of God who rules over all things, for he had implanted in the king's mind a forgetfulness of the things he had previously devised.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.29">Then Hermon and all the king's friends pointed out that the beasts and the armed forces were ready, "O king, according to your eager purpose."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.30">But at these words he was filled with an overpowering wrath, because by the providence of God his whole mind had been deranged in regard to these matters; and with a threatening look he said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.31">"Were your parents or children present, I would have prepared them to be a rich feast for the savage beasts instead of the Jews, who give me no ground for complaint and have exhibited to an extraordinary degree a full and firm loyalty to my ancestors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.32">In fact you would have been deprived of life instead of these, were it not for an affection arising from our nurture in common and your usefulness."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.33">So Hermon suffered an unexpected and dangerous threat, and his eyes wavered and his face fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.34">The king's friends one by one sullenly slipped away and dismissed the assembled people, each to his own occupation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.35">Then the Jews, upon hearing what the king had said, praised the manifest Lord God, King of kings, since this also was his aid which they had received.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.36">The king, however, reconvened the party in the same manner and urged the guests to return to their celebrating.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.37">After summoning Hermon he said in a threatening tone, "How many times, you poor wretch, must I give you orders about these things?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.38">Equip the elephants now once more for the destruction of the Jews tomorrow!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.39">But the officials who were at table with him, wondering at his instability of mind, remonstrated as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.40">"O king, how long will you try us, as though we are idiots, ordering now for a third time that they be destroyed, and again revoking your decree in the matter?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.41">As a result the city is in a tumult because of its expectation; it is crowded with masses of people, and also in constant danger of being plundered."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.42">Upon this the king, a Phalaris in everything and filled with madness, took no account of the changes of mind which had come about within him for the protection of the Jews, and he firmly swore an irrevocable oath that he would send them to death without delay, mangled by the knees and feet of the beasts,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.43">and would also march against Judea and rapidly level it to the ground with fire and spear, and by burning to the ground the temple inaccessible to him would quickly render it forever empty of those who offered sacrifices there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.44">Then the friends and officers departed with great joy, and they confidently posted the armed forces at the places in the city most favorable for keeping guard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.45">Now when the beasts had been brought virtually to a state of madness, so to speak, by the very fragrant draughts of wine mixed with frankincense and had been equipped with frightful devices, the elephant keeper</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.46">entered at about dawn into the courtyard -- the city now being filled with countless masses of people crowding their way into the hippodrome -- and urged the king on to the matter at hand.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.47">So he, when he had filled his impious mind with a deep rage, rushed out in full force along with the beasts, wishing to witness, with invulnerable heart and with his own eyes, the grievous and pitiful destruction of the aforementioned people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.48">And when the Jews saw the dust raised by the elephants going out at the gate and by the following armed forces, as well as by the trampling of the crowd, and heard the loud and tumultuous noise,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.49">they thought that this was their last moment of life, the end of their most miserable suspense, and giving way to lamentation and groans they kissed each other, embracing relatives and falling into one another's arms -- parents and children, mothers and daughters, and others with babies at their breasts who were drawing their last milk.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.50">Not only this, but when they considered the help which they had received before from heaven they prostrated themselves with one accord on the ground, removing the babies from their breasts,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.5.51">and cried out in a very loud voice, imploring the Ruler over every power to manifest himself and be merciful to them, as they stood now at the gates of death.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="3Macc.6" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.1">Then a certain Eleazar, famous among the priests of the country, who had attained a ripe old age and throughout his life had been adorned with every virtue, directed the elders around him to cease calling upon the holy God and prayed as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.2">"King of great power, Almighty God Most High, governing all creation with mercy,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.3">look upon the descendants of Abraham, O Father, upon the children of the sainted Jacob, a people of your consecrated portion who are perishing as foreigners in a foreign land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.4">Pharaoh with his abundance of chariots, the former ruler of this Egypt, exalted with lawless insolence and boastful tongue, you destroyed together with his arrogant army by drowning them in the sea, manifesting the light of your mercy upon the nation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.5">Sennacherib exulting in his countless forces, oppressive king of the Assyrians, who had already gained control of the whole world by the spear and was lifted up against your holy city, speaking grievous words with boasting and insolence, you, O Lord, broke in pieces, showing your power to many nations.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.6">The three companions in Babylon who had voluntarily surrendered their lives to the flames so as not to serve vain things, you rescued unharmed, even to a hair, moistening the fiery furnace with dew and turning the flame against all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.7">Daniel, who through envious slanders was cast down into the ground to lions as food for wild beasts, you brought up to the light unharmed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.8">And Jonah, wasting away in the belly of a huge, sea-born monster, you, Father, watched over and restored unharmed to all his family.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.9">And now, you who hate insolence, all-merciful and protector of all, reveal yourself quickly to those of the nation of Israel -- who are being outrageously treated by the abominable and lawless Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.10">Even if our lives have become entangled in impieties in our exile, rescue us from the hand of the enemy, and destroy us, Lord, by whatever fate you choose.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.11">Let not the vain-minded praise their vanities at the destruction of your beloved people, saying, `Not even their god has rescued them.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.12">But you, O Eternal One, who have all might and all power, watch over us now and have mercy upon us who by the senseless insolence of the lawless are being deprived of life in the manner of traitors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.13">And let the Gentiles cower today in fear of your invincible might, O honored One, who have power to save the nation of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.14">The whole throng of infants and their parents entreat you with tears.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.15">Let it be shown to all the Gentiles that you are with us, O Lord, and have not turned your face from us; but just as you have said, `Not even when they were in the land of their enemies did I neglect them,' so accomplish it, O Lord."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.16">Just as Eleazar was ending his prayer, the king arrived at the hippodrome with the beasts and all the arrogance of his forces.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.17">And when the Jews observed this they raised great cries to heaven so that even the nearby valleys resounded with them and brought an uncontrollable terror upon the army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.18">Then the most glorious, almighty, and true God revealed his holy face and opened the heavenly gates, from which two glorious angels of fearful aspect descended, visible to all but the Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.19">They opposed the forces of the enemy and filled them with confusion and terror, binding them with immovable shackles.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.20">Even the king began to shudder bodily, and he forgot his sullen insolence.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.21">The beasts turned back upon the armed forces following them and began trampling and destroying them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.22">Then the king's anger was turned to pity and tears because of the things that he had devised beforehand.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.23">For when he heard the shouting and saw them all fallen headlong to destruction, he wept and angrily threatened his friends, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.24">"You are committing treason and surpassing tyrants in cruelty; and even me, your benefactor, you are now attempting to deprive of dominion and life by secretly devising acts of no advantage to the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.25">Who is it that has taken each man from his home and senselessly gathered here those who faithfully have held the fortresses of our country?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.26">Who is it that has so lawlessly encompassed with outrageous treatment those who from the beginning differed from all nations in their goodwill toward us and often have accepted willingly the worst of human dangers?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.27">Loose and untie their unjust bonds! Send them back to their homes in peace, begging pardon for your former actions!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.28">Release the sons of the almighty and living God of heaven, who from the time of our ancestors until now has granted an unimpeded and notable stability to our government."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.29">These then were the things he said; and the Jews, immediately released, praised their holy God and Savior, since they now had escaped death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.30">Then the king, when he had returned to the city, summoned the official in charge of the revenues and ordered him to provide to the Jews both wines and everything else needed for a festival of seven days, deciding that they should celebrate their rescue with all joyfulness in that same place in which they had expected to meet their destruction.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.31">Accordingly those disgracefully treated and near to death, or rather, who stood at its gates, arranged for a banquet of deliverance instead of a bitter and lamentable death, and full of joy they apportioned to celebrants the place which had been prepared for their destruction and burial.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.32">They ceased their chanting of dirges and took up the song of their fathers, praising God, their Savior and worker of wonders. Putting an end to all mourning and wailing, they formed choruses as a sign of peaceful joy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.33">Likewise also the king, after convening a great banquet to celebrate these events, gave thanks to heaven unceasingly and lavishly for the unexpected rescue which he had experienced.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.34">And those who had previously believed that the Jews would be destroyed and become food for birds, and had joyfully registered them, groaned as they themselves were overcome by disgrace, and their fire-breathing boldness was ignominiously quenched.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.35">But the Jews, when they had arranged the aforementioned choral group, as we have said before, passed the time in feasting to the accompaniment of joyous thanksgiving and psalms.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.36">And when they had ordained a public rite for these things in their whole community and for their descendants, they instituted the observance of the aforesaid days as a festival, not for drinking and gluttony, but because of the deliverance that had come to them through God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.37">Then they petitioned the king, asking for dismissal to their homes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.38">So their registration was carried out from the twenty-fifth of Pachon to the fourth of Epeiph, for forty days; and their destruction was set for the fifth to the seventh of Epeiph, the three days</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.39">on which the Lord of all most gloriously revealed his mercy and rescued them all together and unharmed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.40">Then they feasted, provided with everything by the king, until the fourteenth day, on which also they made the petition for their dismissal.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.6.41">The king granted their request at once and wrote the following letter for them to the generals in the cities, magnanimously expressing his concern:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="3Macc.7" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.1">"King Ptolemy Philopator to the generals in Egypt and all in authority in his government, greetings and good health.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.2">We ourselves and our children are faring well, the great God guiding our affairs according to our desire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.3">Certain of our friends, frequently urging us with malicious intent, persuaded us to gather together the Jews of the kingdom in a body and to punish them with barbarous penalties as traitors;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.4">for they declared that our government would never be firmly established until this was accomplished, because of the ill-will which these people had toward all nations.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.5">They also led them out with harsh treatment as slaves, or rather as traitors, and, girding themselves with a cruelty more savage than that of Scythian custom, they tried without any inquiry or examination to put them to death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.6">But we very severely threatened them for these acts, and in accordance with the clemency which we have toward all men we barely spared their lives. Since we have come to realize that the God of heaven surely defends the Jews, always taking their part as a father does for his children,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.7">and since we have taken into account the friendly and firm goodwill which they had toward us and our ancestors, we justly have acquitted them of every charge of whatever kind.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.8">We also have ordered each and every one to return to his own home, with no one in any place doing them harm at all or reproaching them for the irrational things that have happened.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.9">For you should know that if we devise any evil against them or cause them any grief at all, we always shall have not man but the Ruler over every power, the Most High God, in everything and inescapably as an antagonist to avenge such acts. Farewell."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.10">Upon receiving this letter the Jews did not immediately hurry to make their departure, but they requested of the king that at their own hands those of the Jewish nation who had willfully transgressed against the holy God and the law of God should receive the punishment they deserved.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.11">For they declared that those who for the belly's sake had transgressed the divine commandments would never be favorably disposed toward the king's government.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.12">The king then, admitting and approving the truth of what they said, granted them a general license so that freely and without royal authority or supervision they might destroy those everywhere in his kingdom who had transgressed the law of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.13">When they had applauded him in fitting manner, their priests and the whole multitude shouted the Hallelujah and joyfully departed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.14">And so on their way they punished and put to a public and shameful death any whom they met of their fellow-countrymen who had become defiled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.15">In that day they put to death more than three hundred men; and they kept the day as a joyful festival, since they had destroyed the profaners.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.16">But those who had held fast to God even to death and had received the full enjoyment of deliverance began their departure from the city, crowned with all sorts of very fragrant flowers, joyfully and loudly giving thanks to the one God of their fathers, the eternal Savior of Israel, in words of praise and all kinds of melodious songs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.17">When they had arrived at Ptolemais, called "rose-bearing" because of a characteristic of the place, the fleet waited for them, in accord with the common desire, for seven days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.18">There they celebrated their deliverance, for the king had generously provided all things to them for their journey, to each as far as his own house.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.19">And when they had landed in peace with appropriate thanksgiving, there too in like manner they decided to observe these days as a joyous festival during the time of their stay.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.20">Then, after inscribing them as holy on a pillar and dedicating a place of prayer at the site of the festival, they departed unharmed, free, and overjoyed, since at the king's command they had been brought safely by land and sea and river each to his own place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.21">They also possessed greater prestige among their enemies, being held in honor and awe; and they were not subject at all to confiscation of their belongings by any one.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.22">Besides they all recovered all of their property, in accordance with the registration, so that those who held any restored it to them with extreme fear. So the supreme God perfectly performed great deeds for their deliverance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="3Macc.7.23">Blessed be the Deliverer of Israel through all times! Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="4Macc.1" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.1">The subject that I am about to discuss is most philosophical, that is, whether devout reason is sovereign over the emotions. So it is right for me to advise you to pay earnest attention to philosophy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.2">For the subject is essential to everyone who is seeking knowledge, and in addition it includes the praise of the highest virtue -- I mean, of course, rational judgment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.3">If, then, it is evident that reason rules over those emotions that hinder self-control, namely, gluttony and lust,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.4">it is also clear that it masters the emotions that hinder one from justice, such as malice, and those that stand in the way of courage, namely anger, fear, and pain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.5">Some might perhaps ask, "If reason rules the emotions, why is it not sovereign over forgetfulness and ignorance?" Their attempt at argument is ridiculous!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.6">For reason does not rule its own emotions, but those that are opposed to justice, courage, and self-control; and it is not for the purpose of destroying them, but so that one may not give way to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.7">I could prove to you from many and various examples that reason is dominant over the emotions,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.8">but I can demonstrate it best from the noble bravery of those who died for the sake of virtue, Eleazar and the seven brothers and their mother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.9">All of these, by despising sufferings that bring death, demonstrated that reason controls the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.10">On this anniversary it is fitting for me to praise for their virtues those who, with their mother, died for the sake of nobility and goodness, but I would also call them blessed for the honor in which they are held.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.11">For all people, even their torturers, marveled at their courage and endurance, and they became the cause of the downfall of tyranny over their nation. By their endurance they conquered the tyrant, and thus their native land was purified through them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.12">I shall shortly have an opportunity to speak of this; but, as my custom is, I shall begin by stating my main principle, and then I shall turn to their story, giving glory to the all-wise God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.13">Our inquiry, accordingly, is whether reason is sovereign over the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.14">We shall decide just what reason is and what emotion is, how many kinds of emotions there are, and whether reason rules over all these.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.15">Now reason is the mind that with sound logic prefers the life of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.16">Wisdom, next, is the knowledge of divine and human matters and the causes of these.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.17">This, in turn, is education in the law, by which we learn divine matters reverently and human affairs to our advantage.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.18">Now the kinds of wisdom are rational judgment, justice, courage, and self-control.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.19">Rational judgment is supreme over all of these, since by means of it reason rules over the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.20">The two most comprehensive types of the emotions are pleasure and pain; and each of these is by nature concerned with both body and soul.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.21">The emotions of both pleasure and pain have many consequences.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.22">Thus desire precedes pleasure and delight follows it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.23">Fear precedes pain and sorrow comes after.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.24">Anger, as a man will see if he reflects on this experience, is an emotion embracing pleasure and pain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.25">In pleasure there exists even a malevolent tendency, which is the most complex of all the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.26">In the soul it is boastfulness, covetousness, thirst for honor, rivalry, and malice;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.27">in the body, indiscriminate eating, gluttony, and solitary gormandizing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.28">Just as pleasure and pain are two plants growing from the body and the soul, so there are many offshoots of these plants,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.29">each of which the master cultivator, reason, weeds and prunes and ties up and waters and thoroughly irrigates, and so tames the jungle of habits and emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.30">For reason is the guide of the virtues, but over the emotions it is sovereign. Observe now first of all that rational judgment is sovereign over the emotions by virtue of the restraining power of self-control.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.31">Self-control, then, is dominance over the desires.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.32">Some desires are mental, others are physical, and reason obviously rules over both.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.33">Otherwise how is it that when we are attracted to forbidden foods we abstain from the pleasure to be had from them? Is it not because reason is able to rule over appetites? I for one think so.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.34">Therefore when we crave seafood and fowl and animals and all sorts of foods that are forbidden to us by the law, we abstain because of domination by reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.1.35">For the emotions of the appetites are restrained, checked by the temperate mind, and all the impulses of the body are bridled by reason.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.2" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.1">And why is it amazing that the desires of the mind for the enjoyment of beauty are rendered powerless?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.2">It is for this reason, certainly, that the temperate Joseph is praised, because by mental effort he overcame sexual desire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.3">For when he was young and in his prime for intercourse, by his reason he nullified the frenzy of the passions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.4">Not only is reason proved to rule over the frenzied urge of sexual desire, but also over every desire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.5">Thus the law says, "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife...or anything that is your neighbor's."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.6">In fact, since the law has told us not to covet, I could prove to you all the more that reason is able to control desires. Just so it is with the emotions that hinder one from justice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.7">Otherwise how could it be that someone who is habitually a solitary gormandizer, a glutton, or even a drunkard can learn a better way, unless reason is clearly lord of the emotions?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.8">Thus, as soon as a man adopts a way of life in accordance with the law, even though he is a lover of money, he is forced to act contrary to his natural ways and to lend without interest to the needy and to cancel the debt when the seventh year arrives.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.9">If one is greedy, he is ruled by the law through his reason so that he neither gleans his harvest nor gathers the last grapes from the vineyard. In all other matters we can recognize that reason rules the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.10">For the law prevails even over affection for parents, so that virtue is not abandoned for their sakes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.11">It is superior to love for one's wife, so that one rebukes her when she breaks the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.12">It takes precedence over love for children, so that one punishes them for misdeeds.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.13">It is sovereign over the relationship of friends, so that one rebukes friends when they act wickedly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.14">Do not consider it paradoxical when reason, through the law, can prevail even over enmity. The fruit trees of the enemy are not cut down, but one preserves the property of enemies from the destroyers and helps raise up what has fallen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.15">It is evident that reason rules even the more violent emotions: lust for power, vainglory, boasting, arrogance, and malice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.16">For the temperate mind repels all these malicious emotions, just as it repels anger -- for it is sovereign over even this.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.17">When Moses was angry with Dathan and Abiram he did nothing against them in anger, but controlled his anger by reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.18">For, as I have said, the temperate mind is able to get the better of the emotions, to correct some, and to render others powerless.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.19">Why else did Jacob, our most wise father, censure the households of Simeon and Levi for their irrational slaughter of the entire tribe of the Shechemites, saying, "Cursed be their anger"?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.20">For if reason could not control anger, he would not have spoken thus.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.21">Now when God fashioned man, he planted in him emotions and inclinations,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.22">but at the same time he enthroned the mind among the senses as a sacred governor over them all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.23">To the mind he gave the law; and one who lives subject to this will rule a kingdom that is temperate, just, good, and courageous.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.2.24">How is it then, one might say, that if reason is master of the emotions, it does not control forgetfulness and ignorance?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.3" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.1">This notion is entirely ridiculous; for it is evident that reason rules not over its own emotions, but over those of the body.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.2">No one of us can eradicate that kind of desire, but reason can provide a way for us not to be enslaved by desire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.3">No one of us can eradicate anger from the mind, but reason can help to deal with anger.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.4">No one of us can eradicate malice, but reason can fight at our side so that we are not overcome by malice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.5">For reason does not uproot the emotions but is their antagonist.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.6">Now this can be explained more clearly by the story of King David's thirst.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.7">David had been attacking the Philistines all day long, and together with the soldiers of his nation had slain many of them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.8">Then when evening fell, he came, sweating and quite exhausted, to the royal tent, around which the whole army of our ancestors had encamped.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.9">Now all the rest were at supper,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.10">but the king was extremely thirsty, and although springs were plentiful there, he could not satisfy his thirst from them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.11">But a certain irrational desire for the water in the enemy's territory tormented and inflamed him, undid and consumed him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.12">When his guards complained bitterly because of the king's craving, two staunch young soldiers, respecting the king's desire, armed themselves fully, and taking a pitcher climbed over the enemy's ramparts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.13">Eluding the sentinels at the gates, they went searching throughout the enemy camp</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.14">and found the spring, and from it boldly brought the king a drink.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.15">But David, although he was burning with thirst, considered it an altogether fearful danger to his soul to drink what was regarded as equivalent to blood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.16">Therefore, opposing reason to desire, he poured out the drink as an offering to God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.17">For the temperate mind can conquer the drives of the emotions and quench the flames of frenzied desires;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.18">it can overthrow bodily agonies even when they are extreme, and by nobility of reason spurn all domination by the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.19">The present occasion now invites us to a narrative demonstration of temperate reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.20">At a time when our fathers were enjoying profound peace because of their observance of the law and were prospering, so that even Seleucus Nicanor, king of Asia, had both appropriated money to them for the temple service and recognized their commonwealth --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.3.21">just at that time certain men attempted a revolution against the public harmony and caused many and various disasters.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.1">Now there was a certain Simon, a political opponent of the noble and good man, Onias, who then held the high priesthood for life. When despite all manner of slander he was unable to injure Onias in the eyes of the nation, he fled the country with the purpose of betraying it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.2">So he came to Apollonius, governor of Syria, Phoenicia, and Cilicia, and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.3">"I have come here because I am loyal to the king's government, to report that in the Jerusalem treasuries there are deposited tens of thousands in private funds, which are not the property of the temple but belong to King Seleucus."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.4">When Apollonius learned the details of these things, he praised Simon for his service to the king and went up to Seleucus to inform him of the rich treasure.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.5">On receiving authority to deal with this matter, he proceeded quickly to our country accompanied by the accursed Simon and a very strong military force.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.6">He said that he had come with the king's authority to seize the private funds in the treasury.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.7">The people indignantly protested his words, considering it outrageous that those who had committed deposits to the sacred treasury should be deprived of them, and did all that they could to prevent it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.8">But, uttering threats, Apollonius went on to the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.9">While the priests together with women and children were imploring God in the temple to shield the holy place that was being treated so contemptuously,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.10">and while Apollonius was going up with his armed forces to seize the money, angels on horseback with lightning flashing from their weapons appeared from heaven, instilling in them great fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.11">Then Apollonius fell down half dead in the temple area that was open to all, stretched out his hands toward heaven, and with tears besought the Hebrews to pray for him and propitiate the wrath of the heavenly army.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.12">For he said that he had committed a sin deserving of death, and that if he were delivered he would praise the blessedness of the holy place before all people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.13">Moved by these words, Onias the high priest, although otherwise he had scruples about doing so, prayed for him lest King Seleucus suppose that Apollonius had been overcome by human treachery and not by divine justice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.14">So Apollonius, having been preserved beyond all expectations, went away to report to the king what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.15">When King Seleucus died, his son Antiochus Epiphanes succeeded to the throne, an arrogant and terrible man,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.16">who removed Onias from the priesthood and appointed Onias's brother Jason as high priest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.17">Jason agreed that if the office were conferred upon him he would pay the king three thousand six hundred and sixty talents annually.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.18">So the king appointed him high priest and ruler of the nation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.19">Jason changed the nation's way of life and altered its form of government in complete violation of the law,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.20">so that not only was a gymnasium constructed at the very citadel of our native land, but also the temple service was abolished.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.21">The divine justice was angered by these acts and caused Antiochus himself to make war on them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.22">For when he was warring against Ptolemy in Egypt, he heard that a rumor of his death had spread and that the people of Jerusalem had rejoiced greatly. He speedily marched against them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.23">and after he had plundered them he issued a decree that if any of them should be found observing the ancestral law they should die.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.24">When, by means of his decrees, he had not been able in any way to put an end to the people's observance of the law, but saw that all his threats and punishments were being disregarded,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.25">even to the point that women, because they had circumcised their sons, were thrown headlong from heights along with their infants, though they had known beforehand that they would suffer this --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.4.26">when, then, his decrees were despised by the people, he himself, through torture, tried to compel everyone in the nation to eat defiling foods and to renounce Judaism.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.1">The tyrant Antiochus, sitting in state with his counselors on a certain high place, and with his armed soldiers standing about him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.2">ordered the guards to seize each and every Hebrew and to compel them to eat pork and food sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.3">If any were not willing to eat defiling food, they were to be broken on the wheel and killed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.4">And when many persons had been rounded up, one man, Eleazar by name, leader of the flock, was brought before the king. He was a man of priestly family, learned in the law, advanced in age, and known to many in the tyrant's court because of his philosophy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.5">When Antiochus saw him he said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.6">"Before I begin to torture you, old man, I would advise you to save yourself by eating pork,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.7">for I respect your age and your gray hairs. Although you have had them for so long a time, it does not seem to me that you are a philosopher when you observe the religion of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.8">Why, when nature has granted it to us, should you abhor eating the very excellent meat of this animal?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.9">It is senseless not to enjoy delicious things that are not shameful, and wrong to spurn the gifts of nature.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.10">It seems to me that you will do something even more senseless if, by holding a vain opinion concerning the truth, you continue to despise me to your own hurt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.11">Will you not awaken from your foolish philosophy, dispel your futile reasonings, adopt a mind appropriate to your years, philosophize according to the truth of what is beneficial,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.13">For consider this, that if there is some power watching over this religion of yours, it will excuse you from any transgression that arises out of compulsion."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.14">When the tyrant urged him in this fashion to eat meat unlawfully, Eleazar asked to have a word.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.15">When he had received permission to speak, he began to address the people as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.16">"We, O Antiochus, who have been persuaded to govern our lives by the divine law, think that there is no compulsion more powerful than our obedience to the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.17">Therefore we consider that we should not transgress it in any respect.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.18">Even if, as you suppose, our law were not truly divine and we had wrongly held it to be divine, not even so would it be right for us to invalidate our reputation for piety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.19">Therefore do not suppose that it would be a petty sin if we were to eat defiling food;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.20">to transgress the law in matters either small or great is of equal seriousness,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.21">for in either case the law is equally despised.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.22">You scoff at our philosophy as though living by it were irrational,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.23">but it teaches us self-control, so that we master all pleasures and desires, and it also trains us in courage, so that we endure any suffering willingly;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.24">it instructs us in justice, so that in all our dealings we act impartially, and it teaches us piety, so that with proper reverence we worship the only real God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.25">"Therefore we do not eat defiling food; for since we believe that the law was established by God, we know that in the nature of things the Creator of the world in giving us the law has shown sympathy toward us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.26">He has permitted us to eat what will be most suitable for our lives, but he has forbidden us to eat meats that would be contrary to this.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.27">It would be tyrannical for you to compel us not only to transgress the law, but also to eat in such a way that you may deride us for eating defiling foods, which are most hateful to us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.28">But you shall have no such occasion to laugh at me,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.29">nor will I transgress the sacred oaths of my ancestors concerning the keeping of the law,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.30">not even if you gouge out my eyes and burn my entrails.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.31">I am not so old and cowardly as not to be young in reason on behalf of piety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.32">Therefore get your torture wheels ready and fan the fire more vehemently!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.33">I do not so pity my old age as to break the ancestral law by my own act.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.5.34">I will not play false to you, O law that trained me, nor will I renounce you, beloved self-control.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="4Macc.6" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.1">When Eleazar in this manner had made eloquent response to the exhortations of the tyrant, the guards who were standing by dragged him violently to the instruments of torture.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.2">First they stripped the old man, who remained adorned with the gracefulness of his piety.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.3">And after they had tied his arms on each side they scourged him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.4">while a herald opposite him cried out, "Obey the king's commands!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.5">But the courageous and noble man, as a true Eleazar, was unmoved, as though being tortured in a dream;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.6">yet while the old man's eyes were raised to heaven, his flesh was being torn by scourges, his blood flowing, and his sides were being cut to pieces.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.7">And though he fell to the ground because his body could not endure the agonies, he kept his reason upright and unswerving.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.8">One of the cruel guards rushed at him and began to kick him in the side to make him get up again after he fell.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.9">But he bore the pains and scorned the punishment and endured the tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.10">And like a noble athlete the old man, while being beaten, was victorious over his torturers;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.11">in fact, with his face bathed in sweat, and gasping heavily for breath, he amazed even his torturers by his courageous spirit.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.12">At that point, partly out of pity for his old age,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.13">partly out of sympathy from their acquaintance with him, partly out of admiration for his endurance, some of the king's retinue came to him and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.14">"Eleazar, why are you so irrationally destroying yourself through these evil things?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.15">We will set before you some cooked meat; save yourself by pretending to eat pork."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.16">But Eleazar, as though more bitterly tormented by this counsel, cried out:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.17">"May we, the children of Abraham, never think so basely that out of cowardice we feign a role unbecoming to us!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.18">For it would be irrational if we, who have lived in accordance with truth to old age and have maintained in accordance with law the reputation of such a life, should now change our course</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.19">become a pattern of impiety to the young, in becoming an example of the eating of defiling food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.20">It would be shameful if we should survive for a little while and during that time be a laughing stock to all for our cowardice,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.21">and if we should be despised by the tyrant as unmanly, and not protect our divine law even to death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.22">Therefore, O children of Abraham, die nobly for your religion!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.23">And you, guards of the tyrant, why do you delay?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.24">When they saw that he was so courageous in the face of the afflictions, and that he had not been changed by their compassion, the guards brought him to the fire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.25">There they burned him with maliciously contrived instruments, threw him down, and poured stinking liquids into his nostrils.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.26">When he was now burned to his very bones and about to expire, he lifted up his eyes to God and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.27">"You know, O God, that though I might have saved myself, I am dying in burning torments for the sake of the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.28">Be merciful to your people, and let our punishment suffice for them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.29">Make my blood their purification, and take my life in exchange for theirs."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.30">And after he said this, the holy man died nobly in his tortures, and by reason he resisted even to the very tortures of death for the sake of the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.31">Admittedly, then, devout reason is sovereign over the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.32">For if the emotions had prevailed over reason, we would have testified to their domination.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.33">But now that reason has conquered the emotions, we properly attribute to it the power to govern.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.34">And it is right for us to acknowledge the dominance of reason when it masters even external agonies. It would be ridiculous to deny it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.6.35">And I have proved not only that reason has mastered agonies, but also that it masters pleasures and in no respect yields to them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.7" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.1">For like a most skilful pilot, the reason of our father Eleazar steered the ship of religion over the sea of the emotions,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.2">and though buffeted by the stormings of the tyrant and overwhelmed by the mighty waves of tortures,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.3">in no way did he turn the rudder of religion until he sailed into the haven of immortal victory.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.4">No city besieged with many ingenious war machines has ever held out as did that most holy man. Although his sacred life was consumed by tortures and racks, he conquered the besiegers with the shield of his devout reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.5">For in setting his mind firm like a jutting cliff, our father Eleazar broke the maddening waves of the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.6">O priest, worthy of the priesthood, you neither defiled your sacred teeth nor profaned your stomach, which had room only for reverence and purity, by eating defiling foods.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.7">O man in harmony with the law and philosopher of divine life!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.8">Such should be those who are administrators of the law, shielding it with their own blood and noble sweat in sufferings even to death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.9">You, father, strengthened our loyalty to the law through your glorious endurance, and you did not abandon the holiness which you praised, but by your deeds you made your words of divine philosophy credible.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.10">O aged man, more powerful than tortures; O elder, fiercer than fire; O supreme king over the passions, Eleazar!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.11">For just as our father Aaron, armed with the censer, ran through the multitude of the people and conquered the fiery angel,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.12">so the descendant of Aaron, Eleazar, though being consumed by the fire, remained unmoved in his reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.13">Most amazing, indeed, though he was an old man, his body no longer tense and firm, his muscles flabby, his sinews feeble, he became young again</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.14">in spirit through reason; and by reason like that of Isaac he rendered the many-headed rack ineffective.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.15">O man of blessed age and of venerable gray hair and of law-abiding life, whom the faithful seal of death has perfected!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.16">If, therefore, because of piety an aged man despised tortures even to death, most certainly devout reason is governor of the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.17">Some perhaps might say, "Not every one has full command of his emotions, because not every one has prudent reason."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.18">But as many as attend to religion with a whole heart, these alone are able to control the passions of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.19">since they believe that they, like our patriarchs Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, do not die to God, but live in God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.20">No contradiction therefore arises when some persons appear to be dominated by their emotions because of the weakness of their reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.21">What person who lives as a philosopher by the whole rule of philosophy, and trusts in God,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.22">and knows that it is blessed to endure any suffering for the sake of virtue, would not be able to overcome the emotions through godliness?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.7.23">For only the wise and courageous man is lord of his emotions.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.8" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.1">For this is why even the very young, by following a philosophy in accordance with devout reason, have prevailed over the most painful instruments of torture.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.2">For when the tyrant was conspicuously defeated in his first attempt, being unable to compel an aged man to eat defiling foods, then in violent rage he commanded that others of the Hebrew captives be brought, and that any who ate defiling food should be freed after eating, but if any were to refuse, these should be tortured even more cruelly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.3">When the tyrant had given these orders, seven brothers -- handsome, modest, noble, and accomplished in every way -- were brought before him along with their aged mother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.4">When the tyrant saw them, grouped about their mother as if in a chorus, he was pleased with them. And struck by their appearance and nobility, he smiled at them, and summoned them nearer and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.5">"Young men, I admire each and every one of you in a kindly manner, and greatly respect the beauty and the number of such brothers. Not only do I advise you not to display the same madness as that of the old man who has just been tortured, but I also exhort you to yield to me and enjoy my friendship.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.6">Just as I am able to punish those who disobey my orders, so I can be a benefactor to those who obey me.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.7">Trust me, then, and you will have positions of authority in my government if you will renounce the ancestral tradition of your national life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.8">And enjoy your youth by adopting the Greek way of life and by changing your manner of living.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.9">But if by disobedience you rouse my anger, you will compel me to destroy each and every one of you with dreadful punishments through tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.10">Therefore take pity on yourselves. Even I, your enemy, have compassion for your youth and handsome appearance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.11">Will you not consider this, that if you disobey, nothing remains for you but to die on the rack?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.12">When he had said these things, he ordered the instruments of torture to be brought forward so as to persuade them out of fear to eat the defiling food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.13">And when the guards had placed before them wheels and joint-dislocators, rack and hooks and catapults and caldrons, braziers and thumbscrews and iron claws and wedges and bellows, the tyrant resumed speaking:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.14">"Be afraid, young fellows, and whatever justice you revere will be merciful to you when you transgress under compulsion."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.15">But when they had heard the inducements and saw the dreadful devices, not only were they not afraid, but they also opposed the tyrant with their own philosophy, and by their right reasoning nullified his tyranny.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.16">Let us consider, on the other hand, what arguments might have been used if some of them had been cowardly and unmanly. Would they not have been these?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.17">"O wretches that we are and so senseless! Since the king has summoned and exhorted us to accept kind treatment if we obey him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.18">why do we take pleasure in vain resolves and venture upon a disobedience that brings death?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.19">O men and brothers, should we not fear the instruments of torture and consider the threats of torments, and give up this vain opinion and this arrogance that threatens to destroy us?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.20">Let us take pity on our youth and have compassion on our mother's age;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.21">and let us seriously consider that if we disobey we are dead!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.22">Also, divine justice will excuse us for fearing the king when we are under compulsion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.23">Why do we banish ourselves from this most pleasant life and deprive ourselves of this delightful world?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.24">Let us not struggle against compulsion nor take hollow pride in being put to the rack.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.25">Not even the law itself would arbitrarily slay us for fearing the instruments of torture.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.26">Why does such contentiousness excite us and such a fatal stubbornness please us, when we can live in peace if we obey the king?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.27">But the youths, though about to be tortured, neither said any of these things nor even seriously considered them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.28">For they were contemptuous of the emotions and sovereign over agonies,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.8.29">so that as soon as the tyrant had ceased counseling them to eat defiling food, all with one voice together, as from one mind, said:</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.2">we are obviously putting our forefathers to shame unless we should practice ready obedience to the law and to Moses our counselor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.3">Tyrant and counselor of lawlessness, in your hatred for us do not pity us more than we pity ourselves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.4">For we consider this pity of yours which insures our safety through transgression of the law to be more grievous than death itself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.5">You are trying to terrify us by threatening us with death by torture, as though a short time ago you learned nothing from Eleazar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.6">And if the aged men of the Hebrews because of their religion lived piously while enduring torture, it would be even more fitting that we young men should die despising your coercive tortures, which our aged instructor also overcame.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.7">Therefore, tyrant, put us to the test; and if you take our lives because of our religion, do not suppose that you can injure us by torturing us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.8">For we, through this severe suffering and endurance, shall have the prize of virtue and shall be with God, for whom we suffer;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.9">but you, because of your bloodthirstiness toward us, will deservedly undergo from the divine justice eternal torment by fire."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.10">When they had said these things the tyrant not only was angry, as at those who are disobedient, but also was enraged, as at those who are ungrateful.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.11">Then at his command the guards brought forward the eldest, and having torn off his tunic, they bound his hands and arms with thongs on each side.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.12">When they had worn themselves out beating him with scourges, without accomplishing anything, they placed him upon the wheel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.13">When the noble youth was stretched out around this, his limbs were dislocated,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.14">and though broken in every member he denounced the tyrant, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.15">"Most abominable tyrant, enemy of heavenly justice, savage of mind, you are mangling me in this manner, not because I am a murderer, or as one who acts impiously, but because I protect the divine law."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.16">And when the guards said, "Agree to eat so that you may be released from the tortures,"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.17">he replied, "You abominable lackeys, your wheel is not so powerful as to strangle my reason. Cut my limbs, burn my flesh, and twist my joints.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.18">Through all these tortures I will convince you that sons of the Hebrews alone are invincible where virtue is concerned."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.19">While he was saying these things, they spread fire under him, and while fanning the flames they tightened the wheel further.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.20">The wheel was completely smeared with blood, and the heap of coals was being quenched by the drippings of gore, and pieces of flesh were falling off the axles of the machine.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.21">Although the ligaments joining his bones were already severed, the courageous youth, worthy of Abraham, did not groan,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.22">but as though transformed by fire into immortality he nobly endured the rackings.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.23">"Imitate me, brothers," he said. "Do not leave your post in my struggle or renounce our courageous brotherhood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.24">Fight the sacred and noble battle for religion. Thereby the just Providence of our ancestors may become merciful to our nation and take vengeance on the accursed tyrant."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.25">When he had said this, the saintly youth broke the thread of life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.26">While all were marveling at his courageous spirit, the guards brought in the next eldest, and after fitting themselves with iron gauntlets having sharp hooks, they bound him to the torture machine and catapult.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.27">Before torturing him, they inquired if he were willing to eat, and they heard this noble decision.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.28">These leopard-like beasts tore out his sinews with the iron hands, flayed all his flesh up to his chin, and tore away his scalp. But he steadfastly endured this agony and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.29">"How sweet is any kind of death for the religion of our fathers!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.30">To the tyrant he said, "Do you not think, you most savage tyrant, that you are being tortured more than I, as you see the arrogant design of your tyranny being defeated by our endurance for the sake of religion?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.31">I lighten my pain by the joys that come from virtue,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.9.32">but you suffer torture by the threats that come from impiety. You will not escape, most abominable tyrant, the judgments of the divine wrath."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.10" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.1">When he too had endured a glorious death, the third was led in, and many repeatedly urged him to save himself by tasting the meat.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.2">But he shouted, "Do you not know that the same father begot me and those who died, and the same mother bore me, and that I was brought up on the same teachings?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.3">I do not renounce the noble kinship that binds me to my brothers."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.4"/>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.5">Enraged by the man's boldness, they disjointed his hands and feet with their instruments, dismembering him by prying his limbs from their sockets,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.6">and breaking his fingers and arms and legs and elbows.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.7">Since they were not able in any way to break his spirit, they abandoned the instruments and scalped him with their fingernails in a Scythian fashion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.8">They immediately brought him to the wheel, and while his vertebrae were being dislocated upon it he saw his own flesh torn all around and drops of blood flowing from his entrails.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.9">When he was about to die, he said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.10">"We, most abominable tyrant, are suffering because of our godly training and virtue,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.11">but you, because of your impiety and bloodthirstiness, will undergo unceasing torments."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.12">When he also had died in a manner worthy of his brothers, they dragged in the fourth, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.13">"As for you, do not give way to the same insanity as your brothers, but obey the king and save yourself."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.14">But he said to them, "You do not have a fire hot enough to make me play the coward.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.15">No, by the blessed death of my brothers, by the eternal destruction of the tyrant, and by the everlasting life of the pious, I will not renounce our noble brotherhood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.16">Contrive tortures, tyrant, so that you may learn from them that I am a brother to those who have just been tortured."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.17">When he heard this, the bloodthirsty, murderous, and utterly abominable Antiochus gave orders to cut out his tongue.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.18">But he said, "Even if you remove my organ of speech, God hears also those who are mute.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.19">See, here is my tongue; cut it off, for in spite of this you will not make our reason speechless.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.20">Gladly, for the sake of God, we let our bodily members be mutilated.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.10.21">God will visit you swiftly, for you are cutting out a tongue that has been melodious with divine hymns."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.11" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.1">When this one died also, after being cruelly tortured, the fifth leaped up, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.2">"I will not refuse, tyrant, to be tortured for the sake of virtue.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.3">I have come of my own accord, so that by murdering me you will incur punishment from the heavenly justice for even more crimes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.4">Hater of virtue, hater of mankind, for what act of ours are you destroying us in this way?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.5">Is it because we revere the Creator of all things and live according to his virtuous law?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.6">But these deeds deserve honors, not tortures."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.7"/>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.9">While he was saying these things, the guards bound him and dragged him to the catapult;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.10">they tied him to it on his knees, and fitting iron clamps on them, they twisted his back around the wedge on the wheel, so that he was completely curled back like a scorpion, and all his members were disjointed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.11">In this condition, gasping for breath and in anguish of body,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.12">he said, "Tyrant, they are splendid favors that you grant us against your will, because through these noble sufferings you give us an opportunity to show our endurance for the law."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.13">After he too had died, the sixth, a mere boy, was led in. When the tyrant inquired whether he was willing to eat and be released, he said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.14">"I am younger in age than my brothers, but I am their equal in mind.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.15">Since to this end we were born and bred, we ought likewise to die for the same principles.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.16">So if you intend to torture me for not eating defiling foods, go on torturing!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.17">When he had said this, they led him to the wheel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.18">He was carefully stretched tight upon it, his back was broken, and he was roasted from underneath.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.19">To his back they applied sharp spits that had been heated in the fire, and pierced his ribs so that his entrails were burned through.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.20">While being tortured he said, "O contest befitting holiness, in which so many of us brothers have been summoned to an arena of sufferings for religion, and in which we have not been defeated!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.21">For religious knowledge, O tyrant, is invincible.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.22">I also, equipped with nobility, will die with my brothers,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.23">and I myself will bring a great avenger upon you, you inventor of tortures and enemy of those who are truly devout.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.24">We six boys have paralyzed your tyranny!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.25">Since you have not been able to persuade us to change our mind or to force us to eat defiling foods, is not this your downfall?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.26">Your fire is cold to us, and the catapults painless, and your violence powerless.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.11.27">For it is not the guards of the tyrant but those of the divine law that are set over us; therefore, unconquered, we hold fast to reason."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.12" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.1">When he also, thrown into the caldron, had died a blessed death, the seventh and youngest of all came forward.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.2">Even though the tyrant had been fearfully reproached by the brothers, he felt strong compassion for this child when he saw that he was already in fetters. He summoned him to come nearer and tried to console him, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.3">"You see the result of your brothers' stupidity, for they died in torments because of their disobedience.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.4">You too, if you do not obey, will be miserably tortured and die before your time,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.5">but if you yield to persuasion you will be my friend and a leader in the government of the kingdom."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.6">When he had so pleaded, he sent for the boy's mother to show compassion on her who had been bereaved of so many sons and to influence her to persuade the surviving son to obey and save himself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.7">But when his mother had exhorted him in the Hebrew language, as we shall tell a little later,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.8">he said, "Let me loose, let me speak to the king and to all his friends that are with him."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.9">Extremely pleased by the boy's declaration, they freed him at once.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.10">Running to the nearest of the braziers,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.11">he said, "You profane tyrant, most impious of all the wicked, since you have received good things and also your kingdom from God, were you not ashamed to murder his servants and torture on the wheel those who practice religion?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.12">Because of this, justice has laid up for you intense and eternal fire and tortures, and these throughout all time will never let you go.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.13">As a man, were you not ashamed, you most savage beast, to cut out the tongues of men who have feelings like yours and are made of the same elements as you, and to maltreat and torture them in this way?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.14">Surely they by dying nobly fulfilled their service to God, but you will wail bitterly for having slain without cause the contestants for virtue."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.15">Then because he too was about to die, he said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.16">"I do not desert the excellent example of my brothers,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.17">and I call on the God of our fathers to be merciful to our nation;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.18">but on you he will take vengeance both in this present life and when you are dead."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.12.19">After he had uttered these imprecations, he flung himself into the braziers and so ended his life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.13" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.1">Since, then, the seven brothers despised sufferings even unto death, everyone must concede that devout reason is sovereign over the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.2">For if they had been slaves to their emotions and had eaten defiling food, we would say that they had been conquered by these emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.3">But in fact it was not so. Instead, by reason, which is praised before God, they prevailed over their emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.4">The supremacy of the mind over these cannot be overlooked, for the brothers mastered both emotions and pains.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.5">How then can one fail to confess the sovereignty of right reason over emotion in those who were not turned back by fiery agonies?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.6">For just as towers jutting out over harbors hold back the threatening waves and make it calm for those who sail into the inner basin,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.7">so the seven-towered right reason of the youths, by fortifying the harbor of religion, conquered the tempest of the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.8">For they constituted a holy chorus of religion and encouraged one another, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.9">"Brothers, let us die like brothers for the sake of the law; let us imitate the three youths in Assyria who despised the same ordeal of the furnace.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.10">Let us not be cowardly in the demonstration of our piety."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.11">While one said, "Courage, brother," another said, "Bear up nobly,"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.12">and another reminded them, "Remember whence you came, and the father by whose hand Isaac would have submitted to being slain for the sake of religion."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.13">Each of them and all of them together looking at one another, cheerful and undaunted, said, "Let us with all our hearts consecrate ourselves to God, who gave us our lives, and let us use our bodies as a bulwark for the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.14">Let us not fear him who thinks he is killing us,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.15">for great is the struggle of the soul and the danger of eternal torment lying before those who transgress the commandment of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.16">Therefore let us put on the full armor of self-control, which is divine reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.17">For if we so die, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob will welcome us, and all the fathers will praise us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.18">Those who were left behind said to each of the brothers who were being dragged away, "Do not put us to shame, brother, or betray the brothers who have died before us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.19">You are not ignorant of the affection of brotherhood, which the divine and all-wise Providence has bequeathed through the fathers to their descendants and which was implanted in the mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.20">There each of the brothers dwelt the same length of time and was shaped during the same period of time; and growing from the same blood and through the same life, they were brought to the light of day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.21">When they were born after an equal time of gestation, they drank milk from the same fountains. For such embraces brotherly-loving souls are nourished;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.22">and they grow stronger from this common nurture and daily companionship, and from both general education and our discipline in the law of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.23">Therefore, when sympathy and brotherly affection had been so established, the brothers were the more sympathetic to one another.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.24">Since they had been educated by the same law and trained in the same virtues and brought up in right living, they loved one another all the more.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.25">A common zeal for nobility expanded their goodwill and harmony toward one another,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.26">because, with the aid of their religion, they rendered their brotherly love more fervent.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.13.27">But although nature and companionship and virtuous habits had augmented the affection of brotherhood, those who were left endured for the sake of religion, while watching their brothers being maltreated and tortured to death.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.14" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.1">Furthermore, they encouraged them to face the torture, so that they not only despised their agonies, but also mastered the emotions of brotherly love.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.2">O reason, more royal than kings and freer than the free!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.3">O sacred and harmonious concord of the seven brothers on behalf of religion!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.4">None of the seven youths proved coward or shrank from death,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.5">but all of them, as though running the course toward immortality, hastened to death by torture.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.6">Just as the hands and feet are moved in harmony with the guidance of the mind, so those holy youths, as though moved by an immortal spirit of devotion, agreed to go to death for its sake.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.7">O most holy seven, brothers in harmony! For just as the seven days of creation move in choral dance around religion,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.8">so these youths, forming a chorus, encircled the sevenfold fear of tortures and dissolved it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.9">Even now, we ourselves shudder as we hear of the tribulations of these young men; they not only saw what was happening, yes, not only heard the direct word of threat, but also bore the sufferings patiently, and in agonies of fire at that.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.10">What could be more excruciatingly painful than this? For the power of fire is intense and swift, and it consumed their bodies quickly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.11">Do not consider it amazing that reason had full command over these men in their tortures, since the mind of woman despised even more diverse agonies,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.12">for the mother of the seven young men bore up under the rackings of each one of her children.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.13">Observe how complex is a mother's love for her children, which draws everything toward an emotion felt in her inmost parts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.14">Even unreasoning animals, like mankind, have a sympathy and parental love for their offspring.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.15">For example, among birds, the ones that are tame protect their young by building on the housetops,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.16">and the others, by building in precipitous chasms and in holes and tops of trees, hatch the nestlings and ward off the intruder.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.17">If they are not able to keep him away, they do what they can to help their young by flying in circles around them in the anguish of love, warning them with their own calls.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.18">And why is it necessary to demonstrate sympathy for children by the example of unreasoning animals,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.19">since even bees at the time for making honeycombs defend themselves against intruders as though with an iron dart sting those who approach their hive and defend it even to the death?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.14.20">But sympathy for her children did not sway the mother of the young men; she was of the same mind as Abraham.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="4Macc.15" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.1">O reason of the children, tyrant over the emotions! O religion, more desirable to the mother than her children!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.2">Two courses were open to this mother, that of religion, and that of preserving her seven sons for a time, as the tyrant had promised.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.3">She loved religion more, religion that preserves them for eternal life according to God's promise.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.4">In what manner might I express the emotions of parents who love their children? We impress upon the character of a small child a wondrous likeness both of mind and of form. Especially is this true of mothers, who because of their birthpangs have a deeper sympathy toward their offspring than do the fathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.5">Considering that mothers are the weaker sex and give birth to many, they are more devoted to their children.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.6">The mother of the seven boys, more than any other mother, loved her children. In seven pregnancies she had implanted in herself tender love toward them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.7">and because of the many pains she suffered with each of them she had sympathy for them;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.8">yet because of the fear of God she disdained the temporary safety of her children.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.9">Not only so, but also because of the nobility of her sons and their ready obedience to the law she felt a greater tenderness toward them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.10">For they were righteous and self-controlled and brave and magnanimous, and loved their brothers and their mother, so that they obeyed her even to death in keeping the ordinances.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.11">Nevertheless, though so many factors influenced the mother to suffer with them out of love for her children, in the case of none of them were the various tortures strong enough to pervert her reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.12">Instead, the mother urged them on, each child singly and all together, to death for the sake of religion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.13">O sacred nature and affection of parental love, yearning of parents toward offspring, nurture and indomitable suffering by mothers!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.14">This mother, who saw them tortured and burned one by one, because of religion did not change her attitude.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.15">She watched the flesh of her children consumed by fire, their toes and fingers scattered on the ground, and the flesh of the head to the chin exposed like masks.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.16">O mother, tried now by more bitter pains than even the birth-pangs you suffered for them!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.17">O woman, who alone gave birth to such complete devotion!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.18">When the first-born breathed his last it did not turn you aside, nor when the second in torments looked at you piteously nor when the third expired;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.19">nor did you weep when you looked at the eyes of each one in his tortures gazing boldly at the same agonies, and saw in their nostrils the signs of the approach of death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.20">When you saw the flesh of children burned upon the flesh of other children, severed hands upon hands, scalped heads upon heads, and corpses fallen on other corpses and when you saw the place filled with many spectators of the torturings, you did not shed tears.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.21">Neither the melodies of sirens nor the songs of swans attract the attention of their hearers as did the voices of the children in torture calling to their mother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.22">How great and how many torments the mother then suffered as her sons were tortured on the wheel and with the hot irons!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.23">But devout reason, giving her heart a man's courage in the very midst of her emotions, strengthened her to disregard her temporal love for her children.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.24">Although she witnessed the destruction of seven children and the ingenious and various rackings, this noble mother disregarded all these because of faith in God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.25">For as in the council chamber of her own soul she saw mighty advocates -- nature, family, parental love, and the rackings of her children --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.26">this mother held two ballots, one bearing death and the other deliverance for her children.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.27">She did not approve the deliverance which would preserve the seven sons for a short time,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.28">but as the daughter of God-fearing Abraham she remembered his fortitude.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.29">O mother of the nation, vindicator of the law and champion of religion, who carried away the prize of the contest in your heart!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.30">O more noble than males in steadfastness, and more manly than men in endurance!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.31">Just as Noah's ark, carrying the world in the universal flood, stoutly endured the waves,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.15.32">so you, O guardian of the law, overwhelmed from every side by the flood of your emotions and the violent winds, the torture of your sons, endured nobly and withstood the wintry storms that assail religion.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="4Macc.16" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.1">If, then, a woman, advanced in years and mother of seven sons, endured seeing her children tortured to death, it must be admitted that devout reason is sovereign over the emotions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.2">Thus I have demonstrated not only that men have ruled over the emotions, but also that a woman has despised the fiercest tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.3">The lions surrounding Daniel were not so savage, nor was the raging fiery furnace of Mishael so intensely hot, as was her innate parental love, inflamed as she saw her seven sons tortured in such varied ways.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.4">But the mother quenched so many and such great emotions by devout reason.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.5">Consider this also. If this woman, though a mother, had been fainthearted, she would have mourned over them and perhaps spoken as follows:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.6">"O how wretched am I and many times unhappy! After bearing seven children, I am now the mother of none!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.7">O seven childbirths all in vain, seven profitless pregnancies, fruitless nurturings and wretched nursings!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.8">In vain, my sons, I endured many birth-pangs for you, and the more grievous anxieties of your upbringing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.9">Alas for my children, some unmarried, others married and without offspring. I shall not see your children or have the happiness of being called grandmother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.10">Alas, I who had so many and beautiful children am a widow and alone, with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.11">Nor when I die, shall I have any of my sons to bury me."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.12">Yet the sacred and God-fearing mother did not wail with such a lament for any of them, nor did she dissuade any of them from dying, nor did she grieve as they were dying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.13">but, as though having a mind like adamant and giving rebirth for immortality to the whole number of her sons, she implored them and urged them on to death for the sake of religion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.14">O mother, soldier of God in the cause of religion, elder and woman! By steadfastness you have conquered even a tyrant, and in word and deed you have proved more powerful than a man.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.15">For when you and your sons were arrested together, you stood and watched Eleazar being tortured, and said to your sons in the Hebrew language,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.16">"My sons, noble is the contest to which you are called to bear witness for the nation. Fight zealously for our ancestral law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.17">For it would be shameful if, while an aged man endures such agonies for the sake of religion, you young men were to be terrified by tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.18">Remember that it is through God that you have had a share in the world and have enjoyed life,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.19">and therefore you ought to endure any suffering for the sake of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.20">For his sake also our father Abraham was zealous to sacrifice his son Isaac, the ancestor of our nation; and when Isaac saw his father's hand wielding a sword and descending upon him, he did not cower.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.21">And Daniel the righteous was thrown to the lions, and Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael were hurled into the fiery furnace and endured it for the sake of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.22">You too must have the same faith in God and not be grieved.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.23">It is unreasonable for people who have religious knowledge not to withstand pain."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.24">By these words the mother of the seven encouraged and persuaded each of her sons to die rather than violate God's commandment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.16.25">They knew also that those who die for the sake of God live in God, as do Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the patriarchs.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="4Macc.17" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.1">Some of the guards said that when she also was about to be seized and put to death she threw herself into the flames so that no one might touch her body.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.2">O mother, who with your seven sons nullified the violence of the tyrant, frustrated his evil designs, and showed the courage of your faith!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.3">Nobly set like a roof on the pillars of your sons, you held firm and unswerving against the earthquake of the tortures.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.4">Take courage, therefore, O holy-minded mother, maintaining firm an enduring hope in God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.5">The moon in heaven, with the stars, does not stand so august as you, who, after lighting the way of your star-like seven sons to piety, stand in honor before God and are firmly set in heaven with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.6">For your children were true descendants of father Abraham.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.7">If it were possible for us to paint the history of your piety as an artist might, would not those who first beheld it have shuddered as they saw the mother of the seven children enduring their varied tortures to death for the sake of religion?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.8">Indeed it would be proper to inscribe upon their tomb these words as a reminder to the people of our nation:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.9">"Here lie buried an aged priest and an aged woman and seven sons, because of the violence of the tyrant who wished to destroy the way of life of the Hebrews.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.10">They vindicated their nation, looking to God and enduring torture even to death."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.11">Truly the contest in which they were engaged was divine,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.12">for on that day virtue gave the awards and tested them for their endurance. The prize was immortality in endless life.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.13">Eleazar was the first contestant, the mother of the seven sons entered the competition, and the brothers contended.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.14">The tyrant was the antagonist, and the world and the human race were the spectators.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.15">Reverence for God was victor and gave the crown to its own athletes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.16">Who did not admire the athletes of the divine legislation? Who were not amazed?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.17">The tyrant himself and all his council marveled at their endurance,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.18">because of which they now stand before the divine throne and live through blessed eternity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.19">For Moses says, "All who are consecrated are under your hands."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.20">These, then, who have been consecrated for the sake of God, are honored, not only with this honor, but also by the fact that because of them our enemies did not rule over our nation,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.21">the tyrant was punished, and the homeland purified -- they having become, as it were, a ransom for the sin of our nation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.22">And through the blood of those devout ones and their death as an expiation, divine Providence preserved Israel that previously had been afflicted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.23">For the tyrant Antiochus, when he saw the courage of their virtue and their endurance under the tortures, proclaimed them to his soldiers as an example for their own endurance,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.17.24">and this made them brave and courageous for infantry battle and siege, and he ravaged and conquered all his enemies.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.3">Therefore those who gave over their bodies in suffering for the sake of religion were not only admired by men, but also were deemed worthy to share in a divine inheritance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.4">Because of them the nation gained peace, and by reviving observance of the law in the homeland they ravaged the enemy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.5">The tyrant Antiochus was both punished on earth and is being chastised after his death. Since in no way whatever was he able to compel the Israelites to become pagans and to abandon their ancestral customs, he left Jerusalem and marched against the Persians.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.6">The mother of seven sons expressed also these principles to her children:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.7">"I was a pure virgin and did not go outside my father's house; but I guarded the rib from which woman was made.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.9">In the time of my maturity I remained with my husband, and when these sons had grown up their father died. A happy man was he, who lived out his life with good children, and did not have the grief of bereavement.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.10">While he was still with you, he taught you the law and the prophets.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.14">He reminded you of the scripture of Isaiah, which says, `Even though you go through the fire, the flame shall not consume you.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.15">He sang to you songs of the psalmist David, who said, `Many are the afflictions of the righteous.'</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.19">`I kill and I make alive: this is your life and the length of your days.'"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="4Macc.18.20">O bitter was that day -- and yet not bitter -- when that bitter tyrant of the Greeks quenched fire with fire in his cruel caldrons, and in his burning rage brought those seven sons of the daughter of Abraham to the catapult and back again to more tortures,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.1">A copy of a letter which Jeremiah sent to those who were to be taken to Babylon as captives by the king of the Babylonians, to give them the message which God had commanded him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.2">Because of the sins which you have committed before God, you will be taken to Babylon as captives by Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Babylonians.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.3">Therefore when you have come to Babylon you will remain there for many years, for a long time, up to seven generations; after that I will bring you away from there in peace.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.4">Now in Babylon you will see gods made of silver and gold and wood, which are carried on men's shoulders and inspire fear in the heathen.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.5">So take care not to become at all like the foreigners or to let fear for these gods possess you, when you see the multitude before and behind them worshiping them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.6">But say in your heart, "It is thou, O Lord, whom we must worship."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.7">For my angel is with you, and he is watching your lives.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.8">Their tongues are smoothed by the craftsman, and they themselves are overlaid with gold and silver; but they are false and cannot speak.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.9">People take gold and make crowns for the heads of their gods, as they would for a girl who loves ornaments;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.10">and sometimes the priests secretly take gold and silver from their gods and spend it upon themselves,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.11">and even give some of it to the harlots in the brothel. They deck their gods out with garments like men -- these gods of silver and gold and wood,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.12">which cannot save themselves from rust and corrosion. When they have been dressed in purple robes,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.13">their faces are wiped because of the dust from the temple, which is thick upon them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.14">Like a local ruler the god holds a scepter, though unable to destroy any one who offends it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.15">It has a dagger in its right hand, and has an axe; but it cannot save itself from war and robbers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.16">Therefore they evidently are not gods; so do not fear them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.17">For just as one's dish is useless when it is broken, so are the gods of the heathen, when they have been set up in the temples. Their eyes are full of the dust raised by the feet of those who enter.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.18">And just as the gates are shut on every side upon a man who has offended a king, as though he were sentenced to death, so the priests make their temples secure with doors and locks and bars, in order that they may not be plundered by robbers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.19">They light lamps, even more than they light for themselves, though their gods can see none of them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.20">They are just like a beam of the temple, but men say their hearts have melted, when worms from the earth devour them and their robes. They do not notice</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.21">when their faces have been blackened by the smoke of the temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.22">Bats, swallows, and birds light on their bodies and heads; and so do cats.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.23">From this you will know that they are not gods; so do not fear them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.24">As for the gold which they wear for beauty -- they will not shine unless some one wipes off the rust; for even when they were being cast, they had no feeling.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.25">They are bought at any cost, but there is no breath in them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.26">Having no feet, they are carried on men's shoulders, revealing to mankind their worthlessness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.27">And those who serve them are ashamed because through them these gods are made to stand, lest they fall to the ground. If any one sets one of them upright, it cannot move itself; and if it is tipped over, it cannot straighten itself; but gifts are placed before them just as before the dead.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.28">The priests sell the sacrifices that are offered to these gods and use the money; and likewise their wives preserve some with salt, but give none to the poor or helpless.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.29">Sacrifices to them may be touched by women in menstruation or at childbirth. Since you know by these things that they are not gods, do not fear them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.30">For why should they be called gods? Women serve meals for gods of silver and gold and wood;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.31">and in their temples the priests sit with their clothes rent, their heads and beards shaved, and their heads uncovered.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.32">They howl and shout before their gods as some do at a funeral feast for a man who has died.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.33">The priests take some of the clothing of their gods to clothe their wives and children.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.34">Whether one does evil to them or good, they will not be able to repay it. They cannot set up a king or depose one.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.35">Likewise they are not able to give either wealth or money; if one makes a vow to them and does not keep it, they will not require it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.36">They cannot save a man from death or rescue the weak from the strong.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.37">They cannot restore sight to a blind man; they cannot rescue a man who is in distress.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.38">They cannot take pity on a widow or do good to an orphan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.39">These things that are made of wood and overlaid with gold and silver are like stones from the mountain, and those who serve them will be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.40">Why then must any one think that they are gods, or call them gods? Besides, even the Chaldeans themselves dishonor them;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.41">for when they see a dumb man, who cannot speak, they bring him and pray Bel that the man may speak, as though Bel were able to understand.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.42">Yet they themselves cannot perceive this and abandon them, for they have no sense.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.43">And the women, with cords about them, sit along the passageways, burning bran for incense; and when one of them is led off by one of the passers-by and is lain with, she derides the woman next to her, because she was not as attractive as herself and her cord was not broken.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.44">Whatever is done for them is false. Why then must any one think that they are gods, or call them gods?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.45">They are made by carpenters and goldsmiths; they can be nothing but what the craftsmen wish them to be.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.46">The men that make them will certainly not live very long themselves; how then can the things that are made by them be gods?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.47">They have left only lies and reproach for those who come after.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.48">For when war or calamity comes upon them, the priests consult together as to where they can hide themselves and their gods.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.49">How then can one fail to see that these are not gods, for they cannot save themselves from war or calamity?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.50">Since they are made of wood and overlaid with gold and silver, it will afterward be known that they are false.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.51">It will be manifest to all the nations and kings that they are not gods but the work of men's hands, and that there is no work of God in them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.52">Who then can fail to know that they are not gods?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.53">For they cannot set up a king over a country or give rain to men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.54">They cannot judge their own cause or deliver one who is wronged, for they have no power; they are like crows between heaven and earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.55">When fire breaks out in a temple of wooden gods overlaid with gold or silver, their priests will flee and escape, but the gods will be burnt in two like beams.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.56">Besides, they can offer no resistance to a king or any enemies. Why then must any one admit or think that they are gods?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.57">Gods made of wood and overlaid with silver and gold are not able to save themselves from thieves and robbers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.58">Strong men will strip them of their gold and silver and of the robes they wear, and go off with this booty, and they will not be able to help themselves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.59">So it is better to be a king who shows his courage, or a household utensil that serves its owner's need, than to be these false gods; better even the door of a house that protects its contents, than these false gods; better also a wooden pillar in a palace, than these false gods.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.60">For sun and moon and stars, shining and sent forth for service, are obedient.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.61">So also the lightning, when it flashes, is widely seen; and the wind likewise blows in every land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.62">When God commands the clouds to go over the whole world, they carry out his command.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.63">And the fire sent from above to consume mountains and woods does what it is ordered. But these idols are not to be compared with them in appearance or power.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.64">Therefore one must not think that they are gods nor call them gods, for they are not able either to decide a case or to do good to men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.65">Since you know then that they are not gods, do not fear them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.66">For they can neither curse nor bless kings;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.67">they cannot show signs in the heavens and among the nations, or shine like the sun or give light like the moon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.68">The wild beasts are better than they are, for they can flee to cover and help themselves.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.69">So we have no evidence whatever that they are gods; therefore do not fear them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.70">Like a scarecrow in a cucumber bed, that guards nothing, so are their gods of wood, overlaid with gold and silver.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.71">In the same way, their gods of wood, overlaid with gold and silver, and like a thorn bush in a garden, on which every bird sits; or like a dead body cast out in the darkness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.72">By the purple and linen that rot upon them you will know that they are not gods; and they will finally themselves be consumed, and be a reproach in the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="EpJer.6.73">Better therefore is a just man who has no idols, for he will be far from reproach.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.2">Then Azariah stood and offered this prayer; in the midst of the fire he opened his mouth and said:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.3">"Blessed art thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and worthy of praise; and thy name is glorified for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.4">For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us, and all thy works are true and thy ways right, and all thy judgments are truth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.5">Thou hast executed true judgments in all that thou hast brought upon us and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers, for in truth and justice thou hast brought all this upon us because of our sins.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.6">For we have sinfully and lawlessly departed from thee, and have sinned in all things and have not obeyed thy commandments;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.7">we have not observed them or done them, as thou hast commanded us that it might go well with us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.8">So all that thou hast brought upon us, and all that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.9">Thou hast given us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful rebels, and to an unjust king, the most wicked in all the world.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.10">And now we cannot open our mouths; shame and disgrace have befallen thy servants and worshipers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.11">For thy name's sake do not give us up utterly, and do not break thy covenant,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.12">and do not withdraw thy mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham thy beloved and for the sake of Isaac thy servant and Israel thy holy one,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.13">to whom thou didst promise to make their descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the sand on the shore of the sea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.14">For we, O Lord, have become fewer than any nation, and are brought low this day in all the world because of our sins.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.15">And at this time there is no prince, or prophet, or leader, no burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, no place to make an offering before thee or to find mercy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.16">Yet with a contrite heart and a humble spirit may we be accepted, as though it were with burnt offerings of rams and bulls, and with tens of thousands of fat lambs;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.17">such may our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and may we wholly follow thee, for there will be no shame for those who trust in thee.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.18">And now with all our heart we follow thee, we fear thee and seek thy face.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.19">Do not put us to shame, but deal with us in thy forbearance and in thy abundant mercy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.20">Deliver us in accordance with thy marvelous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord! Let all who do harm to thy servants be put to shame;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.21">let them be disgraced and deprived of all power and dominion, and let their strength be broken.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.22">Let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God, glorious over the whole world."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.23">Now the king's servants who threw them in did not cease feeding the furnace fires with naphtha, pitch, tow, and brush.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.24">And the flame streamed out above the furnace forty-nine cubits,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.25">and it broke through and burned those of the Chaldeans whom it caught about the furnace.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.26">But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace to be with Azariah and his companions, and drove the fiery flame out of the furnace,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.27">and made the midst of the furnace like a moist whistling wind, so that the fire did not touch them at all or hurt or trouble them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="PrAzar.1.28">Then the three, as with one mouth, praised and glorified and blessed God in the furnace, saying:</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bar.1.8">At the same time, on the tenth day of Sivan, Baruch took the vessels of the house of the Lord, which had been carried away from the temple, to return them to the land of Judah -- the silver vessels which Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, had made,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.2">And Daniel was a companion of the king, and was the most honored of his friends.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.3">Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and every day they spent on it twelve bushels of fine flour and forty sheep and fifty gallons of wine.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.4">The king revered it and went every day to worship it. But Daniel worshiped his own God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.5">And the king said to him, "Why do you not worship Bel?" He answered, "Because I do not revere man-made idols, but the living God, who created heaven and earth and has dominion over all flesh."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.6">The king said to him, "Do you not think that Bel is a living God? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.7">Then Daniel laughed, and said, "Do not be deceived, O king; for this is but clay inside and brass outside, and it never ate or drank anything."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.8">Then the king was angry, and he called his priests and said to them, "If you do not tell me who is eating these provisions, you shall die.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.9">But if you prove that Bel is eating them, Daniel shall die, because he blasphemed against Bel." And Daniel said to the king, "Let it be done as you have said."</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.14">When they had gone out, the king set forth the food for Bel. Then Daniel ordered his servants to bring ashes and they sifted them throughout the whole temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door and sealed it with the king's signet, and departed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.15">In the night the priests came with their wives and children, as they were accustomed to do, and ate and drank everything.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.17">And the king said, "Are the seals unbroken, Daniel?" He answered, "They are unbroken, O king."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.18">As soon as the doors were opened, the king looked at the table, and shouted in a loud voice, "You are great, O Bel; and with you there is no deceit, none at all."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.19">Then Daniel laughed, and restrained the king from going in, and said, "Look at the floor, and notice whose footsteps these are."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.20">The king said, "I see the footsteps of men and women and children."</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.22">Therefore the king put them to death, and gave Bel over to Daniel, who destroyed it and its temple.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.23">There was also a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.25">Daniel said, "I will worship the Lord my God, for he is the living God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.26">But if you, O king, will give me permission, I will slay the dragon without sword or club." The king said, "I give you permission."</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.28">When the Babylonians heard it, they were very indignant and conspired against the king, saying, "The king has become a Jew; he has destroyed Bel, and slain the dragon, and slaughtered the priests."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.29">Going to the king, they said, "Hand Daniel over to us, or else we will kill you and your household."</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.33">Now the prophet Habakkuk was in Judea. He had boiled pottage and had broken bread into a bowl, and was going into the field to take it to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.34">But the angel of the Lord said to Habakkuk, "Take the dinner which you have to Babylon, to Daniel, in the lions' den."</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.36">Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown of his head, and lifted him by his hair and set him down in Babylon, right over the den, with the rushing sound of the wind itself.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.39">So Daniel arose and ate. And the angel of God immediately returned Habakkuk to his own place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.40">On the seventh day the king came to mourn for Daniel. When he came to the den he looked in, and there sat Daniel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.41">And the king shouted with a loud voice, "Thou art great, O Lord God of Daniel, and there is no other besides thee."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Bel.1.42">And he pulled Daniel out, and threw into the den the men who had attempted his destruction, and they were devoured immediately before his eyes.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.0.1-14">Whereas many great teachings have been given to us through the law and the prophets and the others that followed them, on account of which we should praise Israel for instruction and wisdom; and since it is necessary not only that the readers themselves should acquire understanding but also that those who love learning should be able to help the outsiders by both speaking and writing, my grandfather Jesus, after devoting himself especially to the reading of the law and the prophets and the other books of our fathers, and after acquiring considerable proficiency in them, was himself also led to write something pertaining to instruction and wisdom, in order that, by becoming conversant with this also, those who love learning should make even greater progress in living according to the law.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.0.15-26">You are urged therefore to read with good will and attention, and to be indulgent in cases where, despite out diligent labor in translating, we may seem to have rendered some phrases imperfectly. For what was originally expressed in Hebrew does not have exactly the same sense when translated into another language. Not only this work, but even the law itself, the prophecies, and the rest of the books differ not a little as originally expressed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.0.27-36">When I came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Euergetes and stayed for some time, I found opportunity for no little instruction. It seemed highly necessary that I should myself devote some pains and labor to the translation of the following book, using in that period of time great watchfulness and skill in order to complete and publish the book for those living abroad who wished to gain learning, being prepared in character to live according to the law.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.51.20">I directed my soul to her, and through purification I found her. I gained understanding with her from the first, therefore I will not be forsaken.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.51.21">My heart was stirred to seek her, therefore I have gained a good possession.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.51.22">The Lord gave me a tongue as my reward, and I will praise him with it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.51.23">Draw near to me, you who are untaught, and lodge in my school.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.51.24">Why do you say you are lacking in these things, and why are your souls very thirsty?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.51.25">I opened my mouth and said, Get these things for yourselves without money.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.51.26">Put your neck under the yoke, and let your souls receive instruction; it is to be found close by.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.51.27">See with your eyes that I have labored little and found myself much rest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sir.51.28">Get instruction with a large sum of silver, and you will gain by it much gold.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.1">Love righteousness, you rulers of the earth, think of the Lord with uprightness, and seek him with sincerity of heart;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.2">because he is found by those who do not put him to the test, and manifests himself to those who do not distrust him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.3">For perverse thoughts separate men from God, and when his power is tested, it convicts the foolish;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.4">because wisdom will not enter a deceitful soul, nor dwell in a body enslaved to sin.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.5">For a holy and disciplined spirit will flee from deceit, and will rise and depart from foolish thoughts, and will be ashamed at the approach of unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.6">For wisdom is a kindly spirit and will not free a blasphemer from the guilt of his words; because God is witness of his inmost feelings, and a true observer of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.7">Because the Spirit of the Lord has filled the world, and that which holds all things together knows what is said;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.8">therefore no one who utters unrighteous things will escape notice, and justice, when it punishes, will not pass him by.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.9">For inquiry will be made into the counsels of an ungodly man, and a report of his words will come to the Lord, to convict him of his lawless deeds;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.10">because a jealous ear hears all things, and the sound of murmurings does not go unheard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.11">Beware then of useless murmuring, and keep your tongue from slander; because no secret word is without result, and a lying mouth destroys the soul.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.12">Do not invite death by the error of your life, nor bring on destruction by the works of your hands;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.13">because God did not make death, and he does not delight in the death of the living.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.14">For he created all things that they might exist, and the generative forces of the world are wholesome, and there is no destructive poison in them; and the dominion of Hades is not on earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.15">For righteousness is immortal.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.1.16">But ungodly men by their words and deeds summoned death; considering him a friend, they pined away, and they made a covenant with him, because they are fit to belong to his party.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.1">For they reasoned unsoundly, saying to themselves, Short and sorrowful is our life, and there is no remedy when a man comes to his end, and no one has been known to return from Hades.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.2">Because we were born by mere chance, and hereafter we shall be as though we had never been; because the breath in our nostrils is smoke, and reason is a spark kindled by the beating of our hearts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.3">When it is extinguished, the body will turn to ashes, and the spirit will dissolve like empty air.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.4">Our name will be forgotten in time and no one will remember our works; our life will pass away like the traces of a cloud, and be scattered like mist that is chased by the rays of the sun and overcome by its heat.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.5">For our allotted time is the passing of a shadow, and there is no return from our death, because it is sealed up and no one turns back.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.8">Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.9">Let none of us fail to share in our revelry, everywhere let us leave signs of enjoyment, because this is our portion, and this our lot.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.10">Let us oppress the righteous poor man; let us not spare the widow nor regard the gray hairs of the aged.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.11">But let our might be our law of right, for what is weak proves itself to be useless.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.12">"Let us lie in wait for the righteous man, because he is inconvenient to us and opposes our actions; he reproaches us for sins against the law, and accuses us of sins against our training.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.13">He professes to have knowledge of God, and calls himself a child of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.14">He became to us a reproof of our thoughts;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.15">the very sight of him is a burden to us, because his manner of life is unlike that of others, and his ways are strange.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.16">We are considered by him as something base, and he avoids our ways as unclean; he calls the last end of the righteous happy, and boasts that God is his father.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.17">Let us see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen at the end of his life;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.18">for if the righteous man is God's son, he will help him, and will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.19">Let us test him with insult and torture, that we may find out how gentle he is, and make trial of his forbearance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.20">Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for, according to what he says, he will be protected."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.21">Thus they reasoned, but they were led astray, for their wickedness blinded them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.22">and they did not know the secret purposes of God, nor hope for the wages of holiness, nor discern the prize for blameless souls;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.23">for God created man for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.2.24">but through the devil's envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his party experience it.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.5">Having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good, because God tested them and found them worthy of himself;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.6">like gold in the furnace he tried them, and like a sacrificial burnt offering he accepted them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.7">In the time of their visitation they will shine forth, and will run like sparks through the stubble.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.8">They will govern nations and rule over peoples, and the Lord will reign over them for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.9">Those who trust in him will understand truth, and the faithful will abide with him in love, because grace and mercy are upon his elect, and he watches over his holy ones.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.10">But the ungodly will be punished as their reasoning deserves, who disregarded the righteous man and rebelled against the Lord;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.11">for whoever despises wisdom and instruction is miserable. Their hope is vain, their labors are unprofitable, and their works are useless.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.13">their offspring are accursed. For blessed is the barren woman who is undefiled, who has not entered into a sinful union; she will have fruit when God examines souls.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.14">Blessed also is the eunuch whose hands have done no lawless deed, and who has not devised wicked things against the Lord; for special favor will be shown him for his faithfulness, and a place of great delight in the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.15">For the fruit of good labors is renowned, and the root of understanding does not fail.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.16">But children of adulterers will not come to maturity, and the offspring of an unlawful union will perish.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.17">Even if they live long they will be held of no account, and finally their old age will be without honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.3.18">If they die young, they will have no hope and no consolation in the day of decision.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.1">Better than this is childlessness with virtue, for in the memory of virtue is immortality, because it is known both by God and by men.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.2">When it is present, men imitate it, and they long for it when it has gone; and throughout all time it marches crowned in triumph, victor in the contest for prizes that are undefiled.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.3">But the prolific brood of the ungodly will be of no use, and none of their illegitimate seedlings will strike a deep root or take a firm hold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.4">For even if they put forth boughs for a while, standing insecurely they will be shaken by the wind, and by the violence of the winds they will be uprooted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.5">The branches will be broken off before they come to maturity, and their fruit will be useless, not ripe enough to eat, and good for nothing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.6">For children born of unlawful unions are witnesses of evil against their parents when God examines them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.7">But the righteous man, though he die early, will be at rest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.8">For old age is not honored for length of time, nor measured by number of years;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.9">but understanding is gray hair for men, and a blameless life is ripe old age.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.10">There was one who pleased God and was loved by him, and while living among sinners he was taken up.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.11">He was caught up lest evil change his understanding or guile deceive his soul.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.12">For the fascination of wickedness obscures what is good, and roving desire perverts the innocent mind.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.13">Being perfected in a short time, he fulfilled long years;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.14">for his soul was pleasing to the Lord, therefore he took him quickly from the midst of wickedness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.15">Yet the peoples saw and did not understand, nor take such a thing to heart, that God's grace and mercy are with his elect, and he watches over his holy ones.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.16">The righteous man who had died will condemn the ungodly who are living, and youth that is quickly perfected will condemn the prolonged old age of the unrighteous man.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.17">For they will see the end of the wise man, and will not understand what the Lord purposed for him, and for what he kept him safe.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.18">They will see, and will have contempt for him, but the Lord will laugh them to scorn. After this they will become dishonored corpses, and an outrage among the dead for ever;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.4.19">because he will dash them speechless to the ground, and shake them from the foundations; they will be left utterly dry and barren, and they will suffer anguish, and the memory of them will perish.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.6">So it was we who strayed from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness did not shine on us, and the sun did not rise upon us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.7">We took our fill of the paths of lawlessness and destruction, and we journeyed through trackless deserts, but the way of the Lord we have not known.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.12">or as, when an arrow is shot at a target, the air, thus divided, comes together at once, so that no one knows its pathway.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.13">So we also, as soon as we were born, ceased to be, and we had no sign of virtue to show, but were consumed in our wickedness."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.14">Because the hope of the ungodly man is like chaff carried by the wind, and like a light hoarfrost driven away by a storm; it is dispersed like smoke before the wind, and it passes like the remembrance of a guest who stays but a day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.15">But the righteous live for ever, and their reward is with the Lord; the Most High takes care of them.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.21">Shafts of lightning will fly with true aim, and will leap to the target as from a well-drawn bow of clouds,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.22">and hailstones full of wrath will be hurled as from a catapult; the water of the sea will rage against them, and rivers will relentlessly overwhelm them;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.5.23">a mighty wind will rise against them , and like a tempest it will winnow them away. Lawlessness will lay waste the whole earth, and evil-doing will overturn the thrones of rulers.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.11">All good things came to me along with her, and in her hands uncounted wealth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.12">I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom leads them; but I did not know that she was their mother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.13">I learned without guile and I impart without grudging; I do not hide her wealth,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.14">for it is an unfailing treasure for men; those who get it obtain friendship with God, commended for the gifts that come from instruction.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.15">May God grant that I speak with judgment and have thought worthy of what I have received, for he is the guide even of wisdom and the corrector of the wise.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.16">For both we and our words are in his hand, as are all understanding and skill in crafts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.17">For it is he who gave me unerring knowledge of what exists, to know the structure of the world and the activity of the elements;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.18">the beginning and end and middle of times, the alternations of the solstices and the changes of the seasons,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.20">the natures of animals and the tempers of wild beasts, the powers of spirits and the reasonings of men, the varieties of plants and the virtues of roots;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.21">I learned both what is secret and what is manifest,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.22">for wisdom, the fashioner of all things, taught me. For in her there is a spirit that is intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile, clear, unpolluted, distinct, invulnerable, loving the good, keen, irresistible,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.23">beneficent, humane, steadfast, sure, free from anxiety, all-powerful, overseeing all, and penetrating through all spirits that are intelligent and pure and most subtle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.24">For wisdom is more mobile than any motion; because of her pureness she pervades and penetrates all things.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.25">For she is a breath of the power of God, and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty; therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.26">For she is a reflection of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the working of God, and an image of his goodness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.27">Though she is but one, she can do all things, and while remaining in herself, she renews all things; in every generation she passes into holy souls and makes them friends of God, and prophets;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.28">for God loves nothing so much as the man who lives with wisdom.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.29">For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.7.30">for it is succeeded by the night, but against wisdom evil does not prevail.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.3">She glorifies her noble birth by living with God, and the Lord of all loves her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.4">For she is an initiate in the knowledge of God, and an associate in his works.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.7">And if any one loves righteousness, her labors are virtues; for she teaches self-control and prudence, justice and courage; nothing in life is more profitable for men than these.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.8">And if any one longs for wide experience, she knows the things of old, and infers the things to come; she understands turns of speech and the solutions of riddles; she has foreknowledge of signs and wonders and of the outcome of seasons and times.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.9">Therefore I determined to take her to live with me, knowing that she would give me good counsel and encouragement in cares and grief.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.10">Because of her I shall have glory among the multitudes and honor in the presence of the elders, though I am young.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.15">dread monarchs will be afraid of me when they hear of me; among the people I shall show myself capable, and courageous in war.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.16">When I enter my house, I shall find rest with her, for companionship with her has no bitterness, and life with her has no pain, but gladness and joy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.17">When I considered these things inwardly, and thought upon them in my mind, that in kinship with wisdom there is immortality,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.18">and in friendship with her, pure delight, and in the labors of her hands, unfailing wealth, and in the experience of her company, understanding, and renown in sharing her words, I went about seeking how to get her for myself.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.19">As a child I was by nature well endowed, and a good soul fell to my lot;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.8.21">But I perceived that I would not possess wisdom unless God gave her to me -- and it was a mark of insight to know whose gift she was -- so I appealed to the Lord and besought him, and with my whole heart I said:</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.9.12">Then my works will be acceptable, and I shall judge thy people justly, and shall be worthy of the throne of my father.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.9.13">For what man can learn the counsel of God? Or who can discern what the Lord wills?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.9.14">For the reasoning of mortals is worthless, and our designs are likely to fail,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.9.15">for a perishable body weighs down the soul, and this earthy tent burdens the thoughtful mind.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.9.16">We can hardly guess at what is on earth, and what is at hand we find with labor; but who has traced out what is in the heavens?</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.3">But when an unrighteous man departed from her in his anger, he perished because in rage he slew his brother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.4">When the earth was flooded because of him, wisdom again saved it, steering the righteous man by a paltry piece of wood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.5">Wisdom also, when the nations in wicked agreement had been confounded, recognized the righteous man and preserved him blameless before God, and kept him strong in the face of his compassion for his child.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.6">Wisdom rescued a righteous man when the ungodly were perishing; he escaped the fire that descended on the Five Cities.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.8">For because they passed wisdom by, they not only were hindered from recognizing the good, but also left for mankind a reminder of their folly, so that their failures could never go unnoticed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.9">Wisdom rescued from troubles those who served her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.10">When a righteous man fled from his brother's wrath, she guided him on straight paths; she showed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of angels; she prospered him in his labors, and increased the fruit of his toil.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.11">When his oppressors were covetous, she stood by him and made him rich.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.12">She protected him from his enemies, and kept him safe from those who lay in wait for him; in his arduous contest she gave him the victory, so that he might learn that godliness is more powerful than anything.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.13">When a righteous man was sold, wisdom did not desert him, but delivered him from sin. She descended with him into the dungeon,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.14">and when he was in prison she did not leave him, until she brought him the scepter of a kingdom and authority over his masters. Those who accused him she showed to be false, and she gave him everlasting honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.15">A holy people and blameless race wisdom delivered from a nation of oppressors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.16">She entered the soul of a servant of the Lord, and withstood dread kings with wonders and signs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.17">She gave holy men the reward of their labors; she guided them along a marvelous way, and became a shelter to them by day, and a starry flame through the night.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.18">She brought them over the Red Sea, and led them through deep waters;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.10.20">Therefore the righteous plundered the ungodly; they sang hymns, O Lord, to thy holy name, and praised with one accord thy defending hand,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.11.12">for a twofold grief possessed them, and a groaning at the memory of what had occurred.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.11.13">For when they heard that through their own punishments the righteous had received benefit, they perceived it was the Lord's doing.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.11.17">For thy all-powerful hand, which created the world out of formless matter, did not lack the means to send upon them a multitude of bears, or bold lions,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.13.12">and burn the castoff pieces of his work to prepare his food, and eat his fill.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.13.13">But a castoff piece from among them, useful for nothing, a stick crooked and full of knots, he takes and carves with care in his leisure, and shapes it with skill gained in idleness; he forms it like the image of a man,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.13.14">or makes it like some worthless animal, giving it a coat of red paint and coloring its surface red and covering every blemish in it with paint;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.13.15">then he makes for it a niche that befits it, and sets it in the wall, and fastens it there with iron.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.13.16">So he takes thought for it, that it may not fall, because he knows that it cannot help itself, for it is only an image and has need of help.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.13.18">For health he appeals to a thing that is weak; for life he prays to a thing that is dead; for aid he entreats a thing that is utterly inexperienced; for a prosperous journey, a thing that cannot take a step;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.13.19">for money-making and work and success with his hands he asks strength of a thing whose hands have no strength.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.3">but it is thy providence, O Father, that steers its course, because thou hast given it a path in the sea, and a safe way through the waves,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.6">For even in the beginning, when arrogant giants were perishing, the hope of the world took refuge on a raft, and guided by thy hand left to the world the seed of a new generation.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.8">But the idol made with hands is accursed, and so is he who made it; because he did the work, and the perishable thing was named a god.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.11">Therefore there will be a visitation also upon the heathen idols, because, though part of what God created, they became an abomination, and became traps for the souls of men and a snare to the feet of the foolish.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.12">For the idea of making idols was the beginning of fornication, and the invention of them was the corruption of life,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.13">for neither have they existed from the beginning nor will they exist for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.14">For through the vanity of men they entered the world, and therefore their speedy end has been planned.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.15">For a father, consumed with grief at an untimely bereavement, made an image of his child, who had been suddenly taken from him; and he now honored as a god what was once a dead human being, and handed on to his dependents secret rites and initiations.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.16">Then the ungodly custom, grown strong with time, was kept as a law, and at the command of monarchs graven images were worshiped.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.17">When men could not honor monarchs in their presence, since they lived at a distance, they imagined their appearance far away, and made a visible image of the king whom they honored, so that by their zeal they might flatter the absent one as though present.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.18">Then the ambition of the craftsman impelled even those who did not know the king to intensify their worship.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.19">For he, perhaps wishing to please his ruler, skilfully forced the likeness to take more beautiful form,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.24">they no longer keep either their lives or their marriages pure, but they either treacherously kill one another, or grieve one another by adultery,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.28">For their worshipers either rave in exultation, or prophesy lies, or live unrighteously, or readily commit perjury;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.30">But just penalties will overtake them on two counts: because they thought wickedly of God in devoting themselves to idols, and because in deceit they swore unrighteously through contempt for holiness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.14.31">For it is not the power of the things by which men swear, but the just penalty for those who sin, that always pursues the transgression of the unrighteous.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.8">With misspent toil, he forms a futile god from the same clay -- this man who was made of earth a short time before and after a little while goes to the earth from which he was taken, when he is required to return the soul that was lent him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.15.9">But he is not concerned that he is destined to die or that his life is brief, but he competes with workers in gold and silver, and imitates workers in copper; and he counts it his glory that he molds counterfeit gods.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.3">For while they were still busy at mourning, and were lamenting at the graves of their dead, they reached another foolish decision, and pursued as fugitives those whom they had begged and compelled to depart.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.4">For the fate they deserved drew them on to this end, and made them forget what had happened, in order that they might fill up the punishment which their torments still lacked,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.5">and that thy people might experience an incredible journey, but they themselves might meet a strange death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.6">For the whole creation in its nature was fashioned anew, complying with thy commands, that thy children might be kept unharmed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.7">The cloud was seen overshadowing the camp, and dry land emerging where water had stood before, an unhindered way out of the Red Sea, and a grassy plain out of the raging waves,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.8">where those protected by thy hand passed through as one nation, after gazing on marvelous wonders.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.9">For they ranged like horses, and leaped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who didst deliver them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.10">For they still recalled the events of their sojourn, how instead of producing animals the earth brought forth gnats, and instead of fish the river spewed out vast numbers of frogs.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.11">Afterward they saw also a new kind of birds, when desire led them to ask for luxurious food;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.12">for, to give them relief, quails came up from the sea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.13">The punishments did not come upon the sinners without prior signs in the violence of thunder, for they justly suffered because of their wicked acts; for they practiced a more bitter hatred of strangers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.14">Others had refused to receive strangers when they came to them, but these made slaves of guests who were their benefactors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.15">And not only so, but punishment of some sort will come upon the former for their hostile reception of the aliens;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.16">but the latter, after receiving them with festal celebrations, afflicted with terrible sufferings those who had already shared the same rights.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.17">They were stricken also with loss of sight -- just as were those at the door of the righteous man --when, surrounded by yawning darkness, each tried to find the way through his own door.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.18">For the elements changed places with one another, as on a harp the notes vary the nature of the rhythm, while each note remains the same. This may be clearly inferred from the sight of what took place.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.19">For land animals were transformed into water creatures, and creatures that swim moved over to the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.20">Fire even in water retained its normal power, and water forgot its fire-quenching nature.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.21">Flames, on the contrary, failed to consume the flesh of perishable creatures that walked among them, nor did they melt the crystalline, easily melted kind of heavenly food.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Wis.19.22">For in everything, O Lord, thou hast exalted and glorified thy people; and thou hast not neglected to help them at all times and in all places.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.2">In the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the Great, on the first day of Nisan, Mordecai the son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, had a dream.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.3">He was a Jew, dwelling in the city of Susa, a great man, serving in the court of the king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.4">He was one of the captives whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had brought from Jerusalem with Jeconiah king of Judea. And this was his dream:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.5">Behold, noise and confusion, thunders and earthquake, tumult upon the earth!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.6">And behold, two great dragons came forward, both ready to fight, and they roared terribly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.7">And at their roaring every nation prepared for war, to fight against the nation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.8">And behold, a day of darkness and gloom, tribulation and distress, affliction and great tumult upon the earth!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.9">And the whole righteous nation was troubled; they feared the evils that threatened them, and were ready to perish.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.10">Then they cried to God; and from their cry, as though from a tiny spring, there came a great river, with abundant water;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.11">light came, and the sun rose, and the lowly were exalted and consumed those held in honor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.11.12">Mordecai saw in this dream what God had determined to do, and after he awoke he had it on his mind and sought all day to understand it in every detail.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="AddEsth.12" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.12.1">Now Mordecai took his rest in the courtyard with Gabatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king who kept watch in the courtyard.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.12.2">He overheard their conversation and inquired into their purposes, and learned that they were preparing to lay hands upon Artaxerxes the king; and he informed the king concerning them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.12.3">Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and when they confessed they were led to execution.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.12.4">The king made a permanent record of these things, and Mordecai wrote an account of them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.12.5">And the king ordered Mordecai to serve in the court and rewarded him for these things.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.12.6">But Haman, the son of Hammedatha, a Bougaean, was in great honor with the king, and he sought to injure Mordecai and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="AddEsth.13" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.1">This is a copy of the letter: "The Great King, Artaxerxes, to the rulers of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia and to the governors under them, writes thus:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.2">"Having become ruler of many nations and master of the whole world, not elated with presumption of authority but always acting reasonably and with kindness, I have determined to settle the lives of my subjects in lasting tranquillity and, in order to make my kingdom peaceable and open to travel throughout all its extent, to re-establish the peace which all men desire.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.3">"When I asked my counselors how this might be accomplished, Haman, who excels among us in sound judgment, and is distinguished for his unchanging good will and steadfast fidelity, and has attained the second place in the kingdom,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.4">pointed out to us that among all the nations in the world there is scattered a certain hostile people, who have laws contrary to those of every nation and continually disregard the ordinances of the kings, so that the unifying of the kingdom which we honorably intend cannot be brought about.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.5">We understand that this people, and it alone, stands constantly in opposition to all men, perversely following a strange manner of life and laws, and is ill-disposed to our government, doing all the harm they can so that our kingdom may not attain stability.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.6">"Therefore we have decreed that those indicated to you in the letters of Haman, who is in charge of affairs and is our second father, shall all, with their wives and children, be utterly destroyed by the sword of their enemies, without pity or mercy, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar, of this present year,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.7">so that those who have long been and are now hostile may in one day go down in violence to Hades, and leave our government completely secure and untroubled hereafter."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.8">Then Mordecai prayed to the Lord, calling to remembrance all the works of the Lord. He said:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.9">"O Lord, Lord, King who rulest over all things, for the universe is in thy power and there is no one who can oppose thee if it is thy will to save Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.10">For thou hast made heaven and earth and every wonderful thing under heaven,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.11">and thou art Lord of all, and there is no one who can resist thee, who art the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.12">Thou knowest all things; thou knowest, O Lord, that it was not in insolence or pride or for any love of glory that I did this, and refused to bow down to this proud Haman.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.13">For I would have been willing to kiss the soles of his feet, to save Israel!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.14">But I did this, that I might not set the glory of man above the glory of God, and I will not bow down to any one but to thee, who art my Lord; and I will not do these things in pride.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.15">And now, O Lord God and King, God of Abraham, spare thy people; for the eyes of our foes are upon us to annihilate us, and they desire to destroy the inheritance that has been thine from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.16">Do not neglect thy portion, which thou didst redeem for thyself out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.13.17">Hear my prayer, and have mercy upon thy inheritance turn our mourning into feasting, that we may live and sing praise to thy name, O Lord; do not destroy the mouth of those who praise thee."</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.1">And Esther the queen, seized with deathly anxiety, fled to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.2">she took off her splendid apparel and put on the garments of distress and mourning, and instead of costly perfumes she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she utterly humbled her body, and every part that she loved to adorn she covered with her tangled hair.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.3">And she prayed to the Lord God of Israel, and said: Lord, thou only art our King; help me, who am alone and have no helper but thee,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.5">Ever since I was born I have heard in the tribe of my family that thou, O Lord, didst take Israel out of all the nations, and our fathers from among all their ancestors, for an everlasting inheritance, and that thou didst do for them all that thou didst promise.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.6">And now we have sinned before thee, and thou hast given us into the hands of our enemies,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.8">And now they are not satisfied that we are in bitter slavery, but they have covenanted with their idols</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.9">to abolish what thy mouth has ordained and to destroy thy inheritance, to stop the mouths of those who praise thee and to quench thy altar and the glory of thy house,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.10">to open the mouths of the nations for the praise of vain idols, and to magnify for ever a mortal king.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.11">O Lord, do not surrender thy scepter to what has no being; and do not let them mock at our downfall; but turn their plan against themselves, and make an example of the man who began this against us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.12">Remember, O Lord; make thyself known in this time of our affliction, and give me courage, O King of the gods and Master of all dominion!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.13">Put eloquent speech in my mouth before the lion, and turn his heart to hate the man who is fighting against us, so that there may be an end of him and those who agree with him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.14">But save us by thy hand, and help me, who am alone and have no helper but thee, O Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.15">Thou hast knowledge of all things; and thou knowest that I hate the splendor of the wicked and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised and of any alien.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.16">Thou knowest my necessity -- that I abhor the sign of my proud position, which is upon my head on the days when I appear in public. I abhor it like a menstruous rag, and I do not wear it on the days when I am at leisure.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.17">And thy servant has not eaten at Haman's table, and I have not honored the king's feast or drunk the wine of the libations.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.14.18">Thy servant has had no joy since the day that I was brought here until now, except in thee, O Lord God of Abraham.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.15.2">Then, majestically adorned, after invoking the aid of the all-seeing God and Savior, she took her two maids with her,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.15.3">leaning daintily on one,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.15.4">while the other followed carrying her train.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.15.5">She was radiant with perfect beauty, and she looked happy, as if beloved, but her heart was frozen with fear.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.15.6">When she had gone through all the doors, she stood before the king. He was seated on his royal throne, clothed in the full array of his majesty, all covered with gold and precious stones. And he was most terrifying.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.15.7">Lifting his face, flushed with splendor, he looked at her in fierce anger. And the queen faltered, and turned pale and faint, and collapsed upon the head of the maid who went before her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.15.8">Then God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in alarm he sprang from his throne and took her in his arms until she came to herself. And he comforted her with soothing words, and said to her,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.15.10">you shall not die, for our law applies only to the people. Come near."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.15.11">Then he raised the golden scepter and touched it to her neck;</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.15.15">But as she was speaking, she fell fainting.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.16.4">They not only take away thankfulness from among men, but, carried away by the boasts of those who know nothing of goodness, they suppose that they will escape the evil-hating justice of God, who always sees everything.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.16.5">And often many of those who are set in places of authority have been made in part responsible for the shedding of innocent blood, and have been involved in irremediable calamities, by the persuasion of friends who have been entrusted with the administration of public affairs,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="AddEsth.16.14">He thought that in this way he would find us undefended and would transfer the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.2">who in the days of Shalmaneser, king of the Assyrians, was taken into captivity from Thisbe, which is to the south of Kedesh Naphtali in Galilee above Asher.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.3">I, Tobit, walked in the ways of truth and righteousness all the days of my life, and I performed many acts of charity to my brethren and countrymen who went with me into the land of the Assyrians, to Nineveh.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.4">Now when I was in my own country, in the land of Israel, while I was still a young man, the whole tribe of Naphtali my forefather deserted the house of Jerusalem. This was the place which had been chosen from among all the tribes of Israel, where all the tribes should sacrifice and where the temple of the dwelling of the Most High was consecrated and established for all generations for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.5">All the tribes that joined in apostasy used to sacrifice to the calf Baal, and so did the house of Naphtali my forefather.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.6">But I alone went often to Jerusalem for the feasts, as it is ordained for all Israel by an everlasting decree. Taking the first fruits and the tithes of my produce and the first shearings, I would give these to the priests, the sons of Aaron, at the altar.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.7">Of all my produce I would give a tenth to the sons of Levi who ministered at Jerusalem; a second tenth I would sell, and I would go and spend the proceeds each year at Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.8">the third tenth I would give to those to whom it was my duty, as Deborah my father's mother had commanded me, for I was left an orphan by my father.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.9">When I became a man I married Anna, a member of our family, and by her I became the father of Tobias.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.10">Now when I was carried away captive to Nineveh, all my brethren and my relatives ate the food of the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.11">but I kept myself from eating it,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.12">because I remembered God with all my heart.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.13">Then the Most High gave me favor and good appearance in the sight of Shalmaneser, and I was his buyer of provisions.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.14">So I used to go into Media, and once at Rages in Media I left ten talents of silver in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.15">But when Shalmaneser died, Sennacherib his son reigned in his place; and under him the highways were unsafe, so that I could no longer go into Media.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.16">In the days of Shalmaneser I performed many acts of charity to my brethren.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.17">I would give my bread to the hungry and my clothing to the naked; and if I saw any one of my people dead and thrown out behind the wall of Nineveh, I would bury him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.18">And if Sennacherib the king put to death any who came fleeing from Judea, I buried them secretly. For in his anger he put many to death. When the bodies were sought by the king, they were not found.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.19">Then one of the men of Nineveh went and informed the king about me, that I was burying them; so I hid myself. When I learned that I was being searched for, to be put to death, I left home in fear.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.20">Then all my property was confiscated and nothing was left to me except my wife Anna and my son Tobias.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.21">But not fifty days passed before two of Sennacherib's sons killed him, and they fled to the mountains of Ararat. Then Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his place; and he appointed Ahikar, the son of my brother Anael, over all the accounts of his kingdom and over the entire administration.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.1.22">Ahikar interceded for me, and I returned to Nineveh. Now Ahikar was cupbearer, keeper of the signet, and in charge of administration of the accounts, for Esarhaddon had appointed him second to himself. He was my nephew.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.2" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.1">When I arrived home and my wife Anna and my son Tobias were restored to me, at the feast of Pentecost, which is the sacred festival of the seven weeks, a good dinner was prepared for me and I sat down to eat.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.2">Upon seeing the abundance of food I said to my son, "Go and bring whatever poor man of our brethren you may find who is mindful of the Lord, and I will wait for you."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.3">But he came back and said, "Father, one of our people has been strangled and thrown into the market place."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.4">So before I tasted anything I sprang up and removed the body to a place of shelter until sunset.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.5">And when I returned I washed myself and ate my food in sorrow.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.6">Then I remembered the prophecy of Amos, how he said, "Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your festivities into lamentation." And I wept.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.7">When the sun had set I went and dug a grave and buried the body.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.8">And my neighbors laughed at me and said, "He is no longer afraid that he will be put to death for doing this; he once ran away, and here he is burying the dead again!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.9">On the same night I returned from burying him, and because I was defiled I slept by the wall of the courtyard, and my face was uncovered.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.10">I did not know that there were sparrows on the wall and their fresh droppings fell into my open eyes and white films formed on my eyes. I went to physicians, but they did not help me. Ahikar, however, took care of me until he went to Elymais.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.11">Then my wife Anna earned money at women's work.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.12">She used to send the product to the owners. Once when they paid her wages, they also gave her a kid;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.13">and when she returned to me it began to bleat. So I said to her, "Where did you get the kid? It is not stolen, is it? Return it to the owners; for it is not right to eat what is stolen."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.2.14">And she said, "It was given to me as a gift in addition to my wages." But I did not believe her, and told her to return it to the owners; and I blushed for her. Then she replied to me, "Where are your charities and your righteous deeds? You seem to know everything!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.3" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.1">Then in my grief I wept, and I prayed in anguish, saying,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.2">"Righteous art thou, O Lord; all thy deeds and all they ways are mercy and truth, and thou dost render true and righteous judgment for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.3">Remember me and look favorably upon me; do not punish me for my sins and for my unwitting offences and those which my fathers committed before thee.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.4">For they disobeyed thy commandments, and thou gavest us over to plunder, captivity, and death; thou madest us a byword of reproach in all the nations among which we have been dispersed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.5">And now thy many judgments are true in exacting penalty from me for my sins and those of my fathers, because we did not keep thy commandments. For we did not walk in truth before thee.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.6">And now deal with me according to thy pleasure; command my spirit to be taken up, that I may depart and become dust. For it is better for me to die than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and great is the sorrow within me. Command that I now be released from my distress to go to the eternal abode; do not turn thy face away from me."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.7">On the same day, at Ecbatana in Media, it also happened that Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, was reproached by her father's maids,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.8">because she had been given to seven husbands, and the evil demon Asmodeus had slain each of them before he had been with her as his wife. So the maids said to her, "Do you not know that you strangle your husbands? You already have had seven and have had no benefit from any of them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.9">Why do you beat us? If they are dead, go with them! May we never see a son or daughter of yours!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.10">When she heard these things she was deeply grieved, even to the thought of hanging herself. But she said, "I am the only child of my father; if I do this, it will be a disgrace to him, and I shall bring his old age down in sorrow to the grave.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.11">So she prayed by her window and said, "Blessed art thou, O Lord my God, and blessed is thy holy and honored name for ever. May all thy works praise thee for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.12">And now, O Lord, I have turned my eyes and my face toward thee.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.13">Command that I be released from the earth and that I hear reproach no more.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.14">Thou knowest, O Lord, that I am innocent of any sin with man,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.15">and that I did not stain my name or the name of my father in the land of my captivity. I am my father's only child, and he has no child to be his heir, no near kinsman or kinsman's son for whom I should keep myself as wife. Already seven husbands of mine are dead. Why should I live? But if it be not pleasing to thee to take my life, command that respect be shown to me and pity be taken upon me, and that I hear reproach no more."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.16">The prayer of both was heard in the presence of the glory of the great God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.3.17">And Raphael was sent to heal the two of them: to scale away the white films of Tobit's eyes; to give Sarah the daughter of Raguel in marriage to Tobias the son of Tobit, and to bind Asmodeus the evil demon, because Tobias was entitled to possess her. At that very moment Tobit returned and entered his house and Sarah the daughter of Raguel came down from her upper room.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.1">On that day Tobit remembered the money which he had left in trust with Gabael at Rages in Media, and he said to himself;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.2">"I have asked for death. Why do I not call my son Tobias so that I may explain to him about the money before I die?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.3">So he called him and said, "My son, when I die, bury me, and do not neglect your mother. Honor her all the days of your life; do what is pleasing to her, and do not grieve her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.4">Remember, my son, that she faced many dangers for you while you were yet unborn. When she dies bury her beside me in the same grave.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.5">"Remember the Lord our God all your days, my son, and refuse to sin or to transgress his commandments. Live uprightly all the days of your life, and do not walk in the ways of wrongdoing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.6">For if you do what is true, your ways will prosper through your deeds.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.7">Give alms from your possessions to all who live uprightly, and do not let your eye begrudge the gift when you make it. Do not turn your face away from any poor man, and the face of God will not be turned away from you.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.8">If you have many possessions, make your gift from them in proportion; if few, do not be afraid to give according to the little you have.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.9">So you will be laying up a good treasure for yourself against the day of necessity.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.10">For charity delivers from death and keeps you from entering the darkness;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.11">and for all who practice it charity is an excellent offering in the presence of the Most High.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.12">"Beware, my son, of all immorality. First of all take a wife from among the descendants of your fathers and do not marry a foreign woman, who is not of your father's tribe; for we are the sons of the prophets. Remember, my son, that Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, our fathers of old, all took wives from among their brethren. They were blessed in their children, and their posterity will inherit the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.13">So now, my son, love your brethren, and in your heart do not disdain your brethren and the sons and daughters of your people by refusing to take a wife for yourself from among them. For in pride there is ruin and great confusion; and in shiftlessness there is loss and great want, because shiftlessness is the mother of famine.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.14">Do not hold over till the next day the wages of any man who works for you, but pay him at once; and if you serve God you will receive payment. "Watch yourself, my son, in everything you do, and be disciplined in all your conduct.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.15">And what you hate, do not do to any one. Do not drink wine to excess or let drunkenness go with you on your way.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.16">Give of your bread to the hungry, and of your clothing to the naked. Give all your surplus to charity, and do not let your eye begrudge the gift when you made it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.17">Place your bread on the grave of the righteous, but give none to sinners.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.18">Seek advice from every wise man, and do not despise any useful counsel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.19">Bless the Lord God on every occasion; ask him that your ways may be made straight and that all your paths and plans may prosper. For none of the nations has understanding; but the Lord himself gives all good things, and according to his will he humbles whomever he wishes. "So, my son, remember my commands, and do not let them be blotted out of your mind.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.20">And now let me explain to you about the ten talents of silver which I left in trust with Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.4.21">Do not be afraid, my son, because we have become poor. You have great wealth if you fear God and refrain from every sin and do what is pleasing in his sight."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.5" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.1">Then Tobias answered him, "Father, I will do everything that you have commanded me;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.2">but how can I obtain the money when I do not know the man?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.3">Then Tobit gave him the receipt, and said to him, "Find a man to go with you and I will pay him wages as long as I live; and go and get the money."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.4">So he went to look for a man; and he found Raphael, who was an angel,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.5">but Tobias did not know it. Tobias said to him, "Can you go with me to Rages in Media? Are you acquainted with that region?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.6">The angel replied, "I will go with you; I am familiar with the way, and I have stayed with our brother Gabael."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.7">Then Tobias said to him, "Wait for me, and I shall tell my father."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.8">And he said to him, "Go, and do not delay." So he went in and said to his father, "I have found some one to go with me." He said, "Call him to me, so that I may learn to what tribe he belongs, and whether he is a reliable man to go with you."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.9">So Tobias invited him in; he entered and they greeted each other.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.10">Then Tobit said to him, "My brother, to what tribe and family do you belong? Tell me. "</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.11">But he answered, "Are you looking for a tribe and a family or for a man whom you will pay to go with your son?" And Tobit said to him, "I should like to know, my brother, your people and your name."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.12">He replied, "I am Azarias the son of the great Ananias, one of your relatives."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.13">Then Tobit said to him, "You are welcome, my brother. Do not be angry with me because I tried to learn your tribe and family. You are a relative of mine, of a good and noble lineage. For I used to know Ananias and Jathan, the sons of the great Shemaiah, when we went together to Jerusalem to worship and offered the first-born of our flocks and the tithes of our produce. They did not go astray in the error of our brethren. My brother, you come of good stock.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.14">But tell me, what wages am I to pay you -- a drachma a day, and expenses for yourself as for my son?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.15">And besides, I will add to your wages if you both return safe and sound." So they agreed to these terms.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.16">Then he said to Tobias, "Get ready for the journey, and good success to you both." So his son made the preparations for the journey. And his father said to him, "Go with this man; God who dwells in heaven will prosper your way, and may his angel attend you." So they both went out and departed, and the young man's dog was with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.17">But Anna, his mother, began to weep, and said to Tobit, "Why have you sent our child away? Is he not the staff of our hands as he goes in and out before us?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.18">Do not add money to money, but consider it as rubbish as compared to our child.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.19">For the life that is given to us by the Lord is enough for us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.20">And Tobit said to her, "Do not worry, my sister; he will return safe and sound, and your eyes will see him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.5.21">For a good angel will go with him; his journey will be successful, and he will come back safe and sound." Tob 5:[22] So she stopped weeping.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.6" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.1">Now as they proceeded on their way they came at evening to the Tigris river and camped there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.2">Then the young man went down to wash himself. A fish leaped up from the river and would have swallowed the young man;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.3">and the angel said to him, "Catch the fish." So the young man seized the fish and threw it up on the land.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.4">Then the angel said to him, "Cut open the fish and take the heart and liver and gall and put them away safely."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.5">So the young man did as the angel told him; and they roasted and ate the fish. And they both continued on their way until they came near to Ecbatana.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.6">Then the young man said to the angel, "Brother Azarias, of what use is the liver and heart and gall of the fish?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.7">He replied, "As for the heart and liver, if a demon or evil spirit gives trouble to any one, you make a smoke from these before the man or woman, and that person will never be troubled again.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.8">And as for the gall, anoint with it a man who has white films in his eyes, and he will be cured."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.9">When they approached Ecbatana,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.10">the angel said to the young man, "Brother, today we shall stay with Raguel. He is your relative, and he has an only daughter named Sarah. I will suggest that she be given to you in marriage,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.11">because you are entitled to her and to her inheritance, for you are her only eligible kinsman.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.12">The girl is also beautiful and sensible. Now listen to my plan. I will speak to her father, and as soon as we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage. For I know that Raguel, according to the law of Moses, cannot give her to another man without incurring the penalty of death, because you rather than any other man are entitled to the inheritance."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.13">Then the young man said to the angel, "Brother Azarias, I have heard that the girl has been given to seven husbands and that each died in the bridal chamber.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.14">Now I am the only son my father has, and I am afraid that if I go in I will die as those before me did, for a demon is in love with her, and he harms no one except those who approach her. So now I fear that I may die and bring the lives of my father and mother to the grave in sorrow on my account. And they have no other son to bury them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.15">But the angel said to him, "Do you not remember the words with which your father commanded you to take a wife from among your own people? Now listen to me, brother, for she will become your wife; and do not worry about the demon, for this very night she will be given to you in marriage.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.16">When you enter the bridal chamber, you shall take live ashes of incense and lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish so as to make a smoke.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.6.17">Then the demon will smell it and flee away, and will never again return. And when you approach her, rise up, both of you, and cry out to the merciful God, and he will save you and have mercy on you. Do not be afraid, for she was destined for you from eternity. You will save her, and she will go with you, and I suppose that you will have children by her." When Tobias heard these things, he fell in love with her and yearned deeply for her.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.7" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.1">When they reached Ecbatana and arrived at the house of Raguel, Sarah met them and greeted them. They returned her greeting, and she brought them into the house.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.2">Then Raguel said to his wife Edna, "How much the young man resembles my cousin Tobit!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.3">And Raguel asked them, "Where are you from, brethren?" They answered him, "We belong to the sons of Naphtali, who are captives in Nineveh."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.4">So he said to them, "Do you know our brother Tobit?" And they said, "Yes, we do." And he asked them, "Is he in good health?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.5">They replied, "He is alive and in good health." And Tobias said, "He is my father."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.6">Then Raguel sprang up and kissed him and wept.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.7">And he blessed him and exclaimed, "Son of that good and noble man!" When he heard that Tobit had lost his sight, he was stricken with grief and wept.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.8">And his wife Edna and his daughter Sarah wept. They received them very warmly; and they killed a ram from the flock and set large servings of food before them. Then Tobias said to Raphael, "Brother Azarias, speak of those things which you talked about on the journey, and let the matter be settled."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.9">So he communicated the proposal to Raguel. And Raguel said to Tobias, "Eat, drink, and be merry;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.10">for it is your right to take my child. But let me explain the true situation to you.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.11">I have given my daughter to seven husbands, and when each came to her he died in the night. But for the present be merry." And Tobias said, "I will eat nothing here until you make a binding agreement with me."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.12">So Raguel said, "Take her right now, in accordance with the law. You are her relative, and she is yours. The merciful God will guide you both for the best."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.13">Then he called his daughter Sarah, and taking her by the hand he gave her to Tobias to be his wife, saying, "Here she is; take her according to the law of Moses, and take her with you to your father." And he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.14">Next he called his wife Edna, and took a scroll and wrote out the contract; and they set their seals to it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.15">Then they began to eat.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.16">And Raguel called his wife Edna and said to her, "Sister, make up the other room, and take her into it."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.17">so she did as he said, and took her there; and the girl began to weep. But the mother comforted her daughter in her tears, and said to her,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.7.18">"Be brave, my child; the Lord of heaven and earth grant you joy in place of this sorrow of yours. Be brave, my daughter."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.8" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.1">When they had finished eating, they escorted Tobias in to her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.2">As he went he remembered the words of Raphael, and he took the live ashes of incense and put the heart and liver of the fish upon them and made a smoke.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.3">And when the demon smelled the odor he fled to the remotest parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.4">When the door was shut and the two were alone, Tobias got up from the bed and said, "Sister, get up, and let us pray that the Lord may have mercy upon us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.5">And Tobias began to pray, "Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed be thy holy and glorious name for ever. Let the heavens and all thy creatures bless thee.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.6">Thou madest Adam and gavest him Eve his wife as a helper and support. From them the race of mankind has sprung. Thou didst say, `It is not good that the man should be alone; let us make a helper for him like himself.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.7">And now, O Lord, I am not taking this sister of mine because of lust, but with sincerity. Grant that I may find mercy and may grow old together with her."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.8">And she said with him, "Amen."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.9">Then they both went to sleep for the night. But Raguel arose and went and dug a grave,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.10">with the thought, "Perhaps he too will die."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.11">Then Raguel went into his house</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.12">and said to his wife Edna, "Send one of the maids to see whether he is alive; and if he is not, let us bury him without any one knowing about it."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.13">So the maid opened the door and went in, and found them both asleep.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.14">And she came out and told them that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.15">Then Raguel blessed God and said, "Blessed art thou, O God, with every pure and holy blessing. Let thy saints and all thy creatures bless thee; let all thy angels and thy chosen people bless thee for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.16">Blessed art thou, because thou hast made me glad. It has not happened to me as I expected; but thou hast treated us according to thy great mercy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.17">Blessed art thou, because thou hast had compassion on two only children. Show them mercy, O Lord; and bring their lives to fulfilment in health and happiness and mercy."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.18">Then he ordered his servants to fill in the grave.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.19">After this he gave a wedding feast for them which lasted fourteen days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.20">And before the days of the feast were over, Raguel declared by oath to Tobias that he should not leave until the fourteen days of the wedding feast were ended,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.8.21">that then he should take half of Raguel's property and return in safety to his father, and that the rest would be his "when my wife and I die."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.9" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.9.1">Then Tobias called Raphael and said to him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.9.2">"Brother Azarias, take a servant and two camels with you and go to Gabael at Rages in Media and get the money for me; and bring him to the wedding feast.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.9.3">For Raguel has sworn that I should not leave;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.9.4">but my father is counting the days, and if I delay long he will be greatly distressed."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.9.5">So Raphael made the journey and stayed over night with Gabael. He gave him the receipt, and Gabael brought out the money bags with their seals intact and gave them to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.9.6">In the morning they both got up early and came to the wedding feast. And Gabael blessed Tobias and his wife.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.10" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.1">Now his father Tobit was counting each day, and when the days for the journey had expired and they did not arrive,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.2">he said, "Is it possible that he has been detained? Or is it possible that Gabael has died and there is no one to give him the money?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.3">And he was greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.4">And his wife said to him, "The lad has perished; his long delay proves it." Then she began to mourn for him, and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.5">"Am I not distressed, my child, that I let you go, you who are the light of my eyes?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.6">But Tobit said to her, "Be still and stop worrying; he is well."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.7">And she answered him, "Be still and stop deceiving me; my child has perished." And she went out every day to the road by which they had left; she ate nothing in the daytime, and throughout the nights she never stopped mourning for her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding feast had expired which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. At that time Tobias said to Raguel, "Send me back, for my father and mother have given up hope of ever seeing me again."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.8">But his father-in-law said to him, "Stay with me, and I will send messengers to your father, and they will inform him how things are with you."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.9">Tobias replied, "No, send me back to my father."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.10">So Raguel arose and gave him his wife Sarah and half of his property in slaves, cattle, and money.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.11">And when he had blessed them he sent them away, saying, "The God of heaven will prosper you, my children, before I die."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.10.12">He said also to his daughter, "Honor your father-in-law and your mother-in-law; they are now your parents. Let me hear a good report of you. " And he kissed her. And Edna said to Tobias, "The Lord of heaven bring you back safely, dear brother, and grant me to see your children by my daughter Sarah, that I may rejoice before the Lord. See, I am entrusting my daughter to you; do nothing to grieve her."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.11" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.1">After this Tobias went on his way, praising God because he had made his journey a success. And he blessed Raguel and his wife Edna. So he continued on his way until they came near to Nineveh.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.2">Then Raphael said to Tobias, "Are you not aware, brother, of how you left your father?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.3">Let us run ahead of your wife and prepare the house.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.4">And take the gall of the fish with you." So they went their way, and the dog went along behind them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.5">Now Anna sat looking intently down the road for her son.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.6">And she caught sight of him coming, and said to his father, "Behold, your son is coming, and so is the man who went with him!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.7">Raphael said, "I know, Tobias, that your father will open his eyes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.8">You therefore must anoint his eyes with the gall; and when they smart he will rub them, and will cause the white films to fall away, and he will see you."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.9">Then Anna ran to meet them, and embraced her son, and said to him, "I have seen you, my child; now I am ready to die." And they both wept.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.10">Tobit started toward the door, and stumbled. But his son ran to him</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.11">and took hold of his father, and he sprinkled the gall upon his father's eyes, saying, "Be of good cheer, father."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.12">And when his eyes began to smart he rubbed them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.13">and the white films scaled off from the corners of his eyes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.14">Then he saw his son and embraced him, and he wept and said, "Blessed art thou, O God, and blessed is thy name for ever, and blessed are all thy holy angels.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.15">For thou hast afflicted me, but thou hast had mercy upon me; here I see my son Tobias!" And his son went in rejoicing, and he reported to his father the great things that had happened to him in Media.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.16">Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter-in-law at the gate of Nineveh, rejoicing and praising God. Those who saw him as he went were amazed because he could see.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.17">And Tobit gave thanks before them that God had been merciful to him. When Tobit came near to Sarah his daughter-in-law, he blessed her, saying, "Welcome, daughter! Blessed is God who has brought you to us, and blessed are your father and your mother." So there was rejoicing among all his brethren in Nineveh.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.18">Ahikar and his nephew Nadab came,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.11.19">and Tobias' marriage was celebrated for seven days with great festivity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.12" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.1">Tobit then called his son Tobias and said to him, "My son, see to the wages of the man who went with you; and he must also be given more."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.2">He replied, "Father, it would do me no harm to give him half of what I have brought back.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.3">For he has led me back to you safely, he cured my wife, he obtained the money for me, and he also healed you."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.4">The old man said, "He deserves it."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.5">So he called the angel and said to him, "Take half of all that you two have brought back."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.6">Then the angel called the two of them privately and said to them: "Praise God and give thanks to him; exalt him and give thanks to him in the presence of all the living for what he has done for you. It is good to praise God and to exalt his name, worthily declaring the works of God. Do not be slow to give him thanks.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.7">It is good to guard the secret of a king, but gloriously to reveal the works of God. Do good, and evil will not overtake you.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.8">Prayer is good when accompanied by fasting, almsgiving, and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with wrongdoing. It is better to give alms than to treasure up gold.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.9">For almsgiving delivers from death, and it will purge away every sin. Those who perform deeds of charity and of righteousness will have fulness of life;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.10">but those who commit sin are the enemies of their own lives.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.11">"I will not conceal anything from you. I have said, `It is good to guard the secret of a king, but gloriously to reveal the works of God.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.12">And so, when you and your daughter-in-law Sarah prayed, I brought a reminder of your prayer before the Holy One; and when you buried the dead, I was likewise present with you.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.13">When you did not hesitate to rise and leave your dinner in order to go and lay out the dead, your good deed was not hidden from me, but I was with you.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.14">So now God sent me to heal you and your daughter-in-law Sarah.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.15">I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels who present the prayers of the saints and enter into the presence of the glory of the Holy One."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.16">They were both alarmed; and they fell upon their faces, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.17">But he said to them, "Do not be afraid; you will be safe. But praise God for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.18">For I did not come as a favor on my part, but by the will of our God. Therefore praise him for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.19">All these days I merely appeared to you and did not eat or drink, but you were seeing a vision.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.20">And now give thanks to God, for I am ascending to him who sent me. Write in a book everything that has happened."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.21">Then they stood up; but they saw him no more.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.12.22">So they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and acknowledged that the angel of the Lord had appeared to them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Tob.13" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.13.1">Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing, and said: "Blessed is God who lives for ever, and blessed is his kingdom.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.13.3">Acknowledge him before the nations, O sons of Israel; for he has scattered us among them.</verse>

But see what he will do with you; give thanks to him with your full voice. Praise the Lord of righteousness, and exalt the King of the ages. I give him thanks in the land of my captivity, and I show his power and majesty to a nation of sinners. Turn back, you sinners, and do right before him; who knows if he will accept you and have mercy on you?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.13.7">I exalt my God; my soul exalts the King of heaven, and will rejoice in his majesty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.13.8">Let all men speak, and give him thanks in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.13.9">O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will afflict you for the deeds of your sons, but again he will show mercy to the sons of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.13.10">Give thanks worthily to the Lord, and praise the King of the ages, that his tent may be raised for you again with joy.

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Tob.13.11">Many nations will come from afar to the name of the Lord God, bearing gifts in their hands, gifts for the King of heaven. Generations of generations will give you joyful praise.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.1.9">and all who were in Samaria and its surrounding towns, and beyond the Jordan as far as Jerusalem and Bethany and Chelous and Kadesh and the river of Egypt, and Tahpanhes and Raamses and the whole land of Goshen,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.1.10">even beyond Tanis and Memphis, and all who lived in Egypt as far as the borders of Ethiopia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.1.11">But all who lived in the whole region disregarded the orders of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians, and refused to join him in the war; for they were not afraid of him, but looked upon him as only one man, and they sent back his messengers empty-handed and shamefaced.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.1.12">Then Nebuchadnezzar was very angry with this whole region, and swore by his throne and kingdom that he would surely take revenge on the whole territory of Cilicia and Damascus and Syria, that he would kill them by the sword, and also all the inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the people of Ammon, and all Judea, and every one in Egypt, as far as the coasts of the two seas.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.1.13">In the seventeenth year he led his forces against King Arphaxad, and defeated him in battle, and overthrew the whole army of Arphaxad, and all his cavalry and all his chariots.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.1.14">Thus he took possession of his cities, and came to Ecbatana, captured its towers, plundered its markets, and turned its beauty into shame.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.1.15">He captured Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragae and struck him down with hunting spears; and he utterly destroyed him, to this day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.1.16">Then he returned with them to Nineveh, he and all his combined forces, a vast body of troops; and there he and his forces rested and feasted for one hundred and twenty days.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.1">In the eighteenth year, on the twenty-second day of the first month, there was talk in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians about carrying out his revenge on the whole region, just as he said.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.2">He called together all his officers and all his nobles and set forth to them his secret plan and recounted fully, with his own lips, all the wickedness of the region;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.3">and it was decided that every one who had not obeyed his command should be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.4">When he had finished setting forth his plan, Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians called Holofernes, the chief general of his army, second only to himself, and said to him,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.5">"Thus says the Great King, the lord of the whole earth: When you leave my presence, take with you men confident in their strength, to the number of one hundred and twenty thousand foot soldiers and twelve thousand cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.6">Go and attack the whole west country, because they disobeyed my orders.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.7">Tell them to prepare earth and water, for I am coming against them in my anger, and will cover the whole face of the earth with the feet of my armies, and will hand them over to be plundered by my troops,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.8">till their wounded shall fill their valleys, and every brook and river shall be filled with their dead, and overflow;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.9">and I will lead them away captive to the ends of the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.10">You shall go and seize all their territory for me in advance. They will yield themselves to you, and you shall hold them for me till the day of their punishment.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.11">But if they refuse, your eye shall not spare and you shall hand them over to slaughter and plunder throughout your whole region.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.12">For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, what I have spoken my hand will execute.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.13">And you -- take care not to transgress any of your sovereign's commands, but be sure to carry them out just as I have ordered you; and do not delay about it."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.14">So Holofernes left the presence of his master, and called together all the commanders, generals, and officers of the Assyrian army,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.15">and mustered the picked troops by divisions as his lord had ordered him to do, one hundred and twenty thousand of them, together with twelve thousand archers on horseback,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.16">and he organized them as a great army is marshaled for a campaign.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.17">He collected a vast number of camels and asses and mules for transport, and innumerable sheep and oxen and goats for provision;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.18">also plenty of food for every man, and a huge amount of gold and silver from the royal palace.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.19">So he set out with his whole army, to go ahead of King Nebuchadnezzar and to cover the whole face of the earth to the west with their chariots and horsemen and picked troops of infantry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.20">Along with them went a mixed crowd like a swarm of locusts, like the dust of the earth -- a multitude that could not be counted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.21">They marched for three days from Nineveh to the plain of Bectileth, and camped opposite Bectileth near the mountain which is to the north of Upper Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.22">From there Holofernes took his whole army, his infantry, cavalry, and chariots, and went up into the hill country</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.23">and ravaged Put and Lud, and plundered all the people of Rassis and the Ishmaelites who lived along the desert, south of the country of the Chelleans.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.24">Then he followed the Euphrates and passed through Mesopotamia and destroyed all the hilltop cities along the brook Abron, as far as the sea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.25">He also seized the territory of Cilicia, and killed every one who resisted him, and came to the southern borders of Japheth, fronting toward Arabia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.26">He surrounded all the Midianites, and burned their tents and plundered their sheepfolds.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.27">Then he went down into the plain of Damascus during the wheat harvest, and burned all their fields and destroyed their flocks and herds and sacked their cities and ravaged their lands and put to death all their young men with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.2.28">So fear and terror of him fell upon all the people who lived along the seacoast, at Sidon and Tyre, and those who lived in Sur and Ocina and all who lived in Jamnia. Those who lived in Azotus and Ascalon feared him exceedingly.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.3.1">So they sent messengers to sue for peace, and said,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.3.6">Then he went down to the seacoast with his army and stationed garrisons in the hilltop cities and took picked men from them as his allies.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.3.8">And he demolished all their shrines and cut down their sacred groves; for it had been given to him to destroy all the gods of the land, so that all nations should worship Nebuchadnezzar only, and all their tongues and tribes should call upon him as god.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.3.9">Then he came to the edge of Esdraelon, near Dothan, fronting the great ridge of Judea;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.3.10">here he camped between Geba and Scythopolis, and remained for a whole month in order to assemble all the supplies for his army.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Jdt.4" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.1">By this time the people of Israel living in Judea heard of everything that Holofernes, the general of Nebuchadnezzar the king of the Assyrians, had done to the nations, and how he had plundered and destroyed all their temples;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.2">they were therefore very greatly terrified at his approach, and were alarmed both for Jerusalem and for the temple of the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.3">For they had only recently returned from the captivity, and all the people of Judea were newly gathered together, and the sacred vessels and the altar and the temple had been consecrated after their profanation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.4">So they sent to every district of Samaria, and to Kona and Beth-horon and Belmain and Jericho and to Choba and Aesora and the valley of Salem,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.5">and immediately seized all the high hilltops and fortified the villages on them and stored up food in preparation for war -- since their fields had recently been harvested.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.6">And Joakim, the high priest, who was in Jerusalem at the time, wrote to the people of Bethulia and Betomesthaim, which faces Esdraelon opposite the plain near Dothan,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.7">ordering them to seize the passes up into the hills, since by them Judea could be invaded, and it was easy to stop any who tried to enter, for the approach was narrow, only wide enough for two men at the most.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.8">So the Israelites did as Joakim the high priest and the senate of the whole people of Israel, in session at Jerusalem, had given order.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.9">And every man of Israel cried out to God with great fervor, and they humbled themselves with much fasting.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.10">They and their wives and their children and their cattle and every resident alien and hired laborer and purchased slave -- they all girded themselves with sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.11">And all the men and women of Israel, and their children, living at Jerusalem, prostrated themselves before the temple and put ashes on their heads and spread out their sackcloth before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.12">They even surrounded the altar with sackcloth and cried out in unison, praying earnestly to the God of Israel not to give up their infants as prey and their wives as booty, and the cities they had inherited to be destroyed, and the sanctuary to be profaned and desecrated to the malicious joy of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.13">So the Lord heard their prayers and looked upon their affliction; for the people fasted many days throughout Judea and in Jerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.14">And Joakim the high priest and all the priests who stood before the Lord and ministered to the Lord, with their loins girded with sackcloth, offered the continual burnt offerings and the vows and freewill offerings of the people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.4.15">With ashes upon their turbans, they cried out to the Lord with all their might to look with favor upon the whole house of Israel.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.1">When Holofernes, the general of the Assyrian army, heard that the people of Israel had prepared for war and had closed the passes in the hills and fortified all the high hilltops and set up barricades in the plains,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.2">he was very angry. So he called together all the princes of Moab and the commanders of Ammon and all the governors of the coastland,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.3">and said to them, "Tell me, you Canaanites, what people is this that lives in the hill country? What cities do they inhabit? How large is their army, and in what does their power or strength consist? Who rules over them as king, leading their army?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.4">And why have they alone, of all who live in the west, refused to come out and meet me?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.5">Then Achior, the leader of all the Ammonites, said to him, "Let my lord now hear a word from the mouth of your servant, and I will tell you the truth about this people that dwells in the nearby mountain district. No falsehood shall come from your servant's mouth.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.6">This people is descended from the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.7">At one time they lived in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the gods of their fathers who were in Chaldea.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.8">For they had left the ways of their ancestors, and they worshiped the God of heaven, the God they had come to know; hence they drove them out from the presence of their gods; and they fled to Mesopotamia, and lived there for a long time.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.9">Then their God commanded them to leave the place where they were living and go to the land of Canaan. There they settled, and prospered, with much gold and silver and very many cattle.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.10">When a famine spread over Canaan they went down to Egypt and lived there as long as they had food; and there they became a great multitude -- so great that they could not be counted.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.11">So the king of Egypt became hostile to them; he took advantage of them and set them to making bricks, and humbled them and made slaves of them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.12">Then they cried out to their God, and he afflicted the whole land of Egypt with incurable plagues; and so the Egyptians drove them out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.13">Then God dried up the Red Sea before them,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.14">and he led them by the way of Sinai and Kadesh-barnea, and drove out all the people of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.15">So they lived in the land of the Amorites, and by their might destroyed all the inhabitants of Heshbon; and crossing over the Jordan they took possession of all the hill country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.16">And they drove out before them the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Jebusites and the Shechemites and all the Gergesites, and lived there a long time.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.17">As long as they did not sin against their God they prospered, for the God who hates iniquity is with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.18">But when they departed from the way which he had appointed for them, they were utterly defeated in many battles and were led away captive to a foreign country; the temple of their God was razed to the ground, and their cities were captured by their enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.19">But now they have returned to their God, and have come back from the places to which they were scattered, and have occupied Jerusalem, where their sanctuary is, and have settled in the hill country, because it was uninhabited.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.20">Now therefore, my master and lord, if there is any unwitting error in this people and they sin against their God and we find out their offense, then we will go up and defeat them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.21">But if there is no transgression in their nation, then let my lord pass them by; for their Lord will defend them, and their God will protect them, and we shall be put to shame before the whole world."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.22">When Achior had finished saying this, all the men standing around the tent began to complain; Holofernes' officers and all the men from the seacoast and from Moab insisted that he must be put to death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.5.23">"For," they said, "we will not be afraid of the Israelites; they are a people with no strength or power for making war.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.1">When the disturbance made by the men outside the council died down, Holofernes, the commander of the Assyrian army, said to Achior and all the Moabites in the presence of all the foreign contingents:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.2">"And who are you, Achior, and you hirelings of Ephraim, to prophesy among us as you have done today and tell us not to make war against the people of Israel because their God will defend them? Who is God except Nebuchadnezzar?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.3">He will send his forces and will destroy them from the face of the earth, and their God will not deliver them -- we the king's servants will destroy them as one man. They cannot resist the might of our cavalry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.4">We will burn them up, and their mountains will be drunk with their blood, and their fields will be full of their dead. They cannot withstand us, but will utterly perish. So says King Nebuchadnezzar, the lord of the whole earth. For he has spoken; none of his words shall be in vain.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.5">"But you, Achior, you Ammonite hireling, who have said these words on the day of your iniquity, you shall not see my face again from this day until I take revenge on this race that came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.6">Then the sword of my army and the spear of my servants shall pierce your sides, and you shall fall among their wounded, when I return.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.9">If you really hope in your heart that they will not be taken, do not look downcast! I have spoken and none of my words shall fail."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.10">Then Holofernes ordered his slaves, who waited on him in his tent, to seize Achior and take him to Bethulia and hand him over to the men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.11">So the slaves took him and led him out of the camp into the plain, and from the plain they went up into the hill country and came to the springs below Bethulia.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.12">When the men of the city saw them, they caught up their weapons and ran out of the city to the top of the hill, and all the slingers kept them from coming up by casting stones at them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.13">However, they got under the shelter of the hill and they bound Achior and left him lying at the foot of the hill, and returned to their master.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.14">Then the men of Israel came down from their city and found him; and they untied him and brought him into Bethulia and placed him before the magistrates of their city,</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.16">They called together all the elders of the city, and all their young men and their women ran to the assembly; and they set Achior in the midst of all their people, and Uzziah asked him what had happened.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.17">He answered and told them what had taken place at the council of Holofernes, and all that he had said in the presence of the Assyrian leaders, and all that Holofernes had said so boastfully against the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.6.18">Then the people fell down and worshiped God, and cried out to him, and said,</verse>

The rest of the Assyrian army encamped in the plain, and covered the whole face of the land, and their tents and supply trains spread out in great number, and they formed a vast multitude.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.19">The people of Israel cried out to the Lord their God, for their courage failed, because all their enemies had surrounded them and there was no way of escape from them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.20">The whole Assyrian army, their infantry, chariots, and cavalry, surrounded them for thirty-four days, until all the vessels of water belonging to every inhabitant of Bethulia were empty;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.21">their cisterns were going dry, and they did not have enough water to drink their fill for a single day, because it was measured out to them to drink.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.22">Their children lost heart, and the women and young men fainted from thirst and fell down in the streets of the city and in the passages through the gates; there was no strength left in them any longer.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.23">Then all the people, the young men, the women, and the children, gathered about Uzziah and the rulers of the city and cried out with a loud voice, and said before all the elders,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.24">"God be judge between you and us! For you have done us a great injury in not making peace with the Assyrians.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.25">For now we have no one to help us; God has sold us into their hands, to strew us on the ground before them with thirst and utter destruction.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.26">Now call them in and surrender the whole city to the army of Holofernes and to all his forces, to be plundered.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.27">For it would be better for us to be captured by them; for we will be slaves, but our lives will be spared, and we shall not witness the death of our babes before our eyes, or see our wives and children draw their last breath.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.28">We call to witness against you heaven and earth and our God, the Lord of our fathers, who punishes us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers. Let him not do this day the things which we have described!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.29">Then great and general lamentation arose throughout the assembly, and they cried out to the Lord God with a loud voice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.30">And Uzziah said to them, "Have courage, my brothers! Let us hold out for five more days; by that time the Lord our God will restore to us his mercy, for he will not forsake us utterly.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.31">But if these days pass by, and no help comes for us, I will do what you say."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.7.32">Then he dismissed the people to their various posts, and they went up on the walls and towers of their city. The women and children he sent home. And they were greatly depressed in the city.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Jdt.8" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.1">At that time Judith heard about these things: she was the daughter of Merari the son of Ox, son of Joseph, son of Oziel, son of Elkiah, son of Ananias, son of Gideon, son of Raphaim, son of Ahitub, son of Elijah, son of Hilkiah, son of Eliab, son of Nathanael, son of Salamiel, son of Sarasadai, son of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.2">Her husband Manasseh, who belonged to her tribe and family, had died during the barley harvest.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.3">For as he stood overseeing the men who were binding sheaves in the field, he was overcome by the burning heat, and took to his bed and died in Bethulia his city. So they buried him with his fathers in the field between Dothan and Balamon.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.4">Judith had lived at home as a widow for three years and four months.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.5">She set up a tent for herself on the roof of her house, and girded sackcloth about her loins and wore the garments of her widowhood.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.6">She fasted all the days of her widowhood, except the day before the sabbath and the sabbath itself, the day before the new moon and the day of the new moon, and the feasts and days of rejoicing of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.7">She was beautiful in appearance, and had a very lovely face; and her husband Manasseh had left her gold and silver, and men and women slaves, and cattle, and fields; and she maintained this estate.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.8">No one spoke ill of her, for she feared God with great devotion.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.9">When Judith heard the wicked words spoken by the people against the ruler, because they were faint for lack of water, and when she heard all that Uzziah said to them, and how he promised them under oath to surrender the city to the Assyrians after five days,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.10">she sent her maid, who was in charge of all she possessed, to summon Chabris and Charmis, the elders of her city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.11">They came to her, and she said to them, "Listen to me, rulers of the people of Bethulia! What you have said to the people today is not right; you have even sworn and pronounced this oath between God and you, promising to surrender the city to our enemies unless the Lord turns and helps us within so many days.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.12">Who are you, that have put God to the test this day, and are setting yourselves up in the place of God among the sons of men?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.13">You are putting the Lord Almighty to the test -- but you will never know anything!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.14">You cannot plumb the depths of the human heart, nor find out what a man is thinking; how do you expect to search out God, who made all these things, and find out his mind or comprehend his thought? No, my brethren, do not provoke the Lord our God to anger.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.15">For if he does not choose to help us within these five days, he has power to protect us within any time he pleases, or even to destroy us in the presence of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.16">Do not try to bind the purposes of the Lord our God; for God is not like man, to be threatened, nor like a human being, to be won over by pleading.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.17">Therefore, while we wait for his deliverance, let us call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it pleases him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.18">"For never in our generation, nor in these present days, has there been any tribe or family or people or city of ours which worshiped gods made with hands, as was done in days gone by --</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.19">and that was why our fathers were handed over to the sword, and to be plundered, and so they suffered a great catastrophe before our enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.20">But we know no other god but him, and therefore we hope that he will not disdain us or any of our nation.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.21">For if we are captured all Judea will be captured and our sanctuary will be plundered; and he will exact of us the penalty for its desecration.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.22">And the slaughter of our brethren and the captivity of the land and the desolation of our inheritance -- all this he will bring upon our heads among the Gentiles, wherever we serve as slaves; and we shall be an offense and a reproach in the eyes of those who acquire us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.23">For our slavery will not bring us into favor, but the Lord our God will turn it to dishonor.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.24">"Now therefore, brethren, let us set an example to our brethren, for their lives depend upon us, and the sanctuary and the temple and the altar rest upon us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.25">In spite of everything let us give thanks to the Lord our God, who is putting us to the test as he did our forefathers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.26">Remember what he did with Abraham, and how he tested Isaac, and what happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia in Syria, while he was keeping the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.27">For he has not tried us with fire, as he did them, to search their hearts, nor has he taken revenge upon us; but the Lord scourges those who draw near to him, in order to admonish them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.28">Then Uzziah said to her, "All that you have said has been spoken out of a true heart, and there is no one who can deny your words.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.29">Today is not the first time your wisdom has been shown, but from the beginning of your life all the people have recognized your understanding, for your heart's disposition is right.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.30">But the people were very thirsty, and they compelled us to do for them what we have promised, and made us take an oath which we cannot break.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.31">So pray for us, since you are a devout woman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns and we will no longer be faint."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.32">Judith said to them, "Listen to me. I am about to do a thing which will go down through all generations of our descendants.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.33">Stand at the city gate tonight, and I will go out with my maid; and within the days after which you have promised to surrender the city to our enemies, the Lord will deliver Israel by my hand.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.34">Only, do not try to find out what I plan; for I will not tell you until I have finished what I am about to do."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.35">Uzziah and the rulers said to her, "Go in peace, and may the Lord God go before you, to take revenge upon our enemies."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.8.36">So they returned from the tent and went to their posts.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.1">Then Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes on her head, and uncovered the sackcloth she was wearing; and at the very time when that evening's incense was being offered in the house of God in Jerusalem, Judith cried out to the Lord with a loud voice, and said,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.2">"O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a sword to take revenge on the strangers who had loosed the girdle of a virgin to defile her, and uncovered her thigh to put her to shame, and polluted her womb to disgrace her; for thou hast said, `It shall not be done' -- yet they did it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.3">So thou gavest up their rulers to be slain, and their bed, which was ashamed of the deceit they had practiced, to be stained with blood, and thou didst strike down slaves along with princes, and princes on their thrones;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.4">and thou gavest their wives for a prey and their daughters to captivity, and all their booty to be divided among thy beloved sons, who were zealous for thee, and abhorred the pollution of their blood, and called on thee for help -- O God, my God, hear me also, a widow.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.5">"For thou hast done these things and those that went before and those that followed; thou hast designed the things that are now, and those that are to come. Yea, the things thou didst intend came to pass,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.6">and the things thou didst will presented themselves and said, `Lo, we are here'; for all they ways are prepared in advance, and thy judgment is with foreknowledge.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.7">"Behold now, the Assyrians are increased in their might; they are exalted, with their horses and riders; they glory in the strength of their foot soldiers; they trust in shield and spear, in bow and sling, and know not that thou art the Lord who crushest wars; the Lord is thy name.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.8">Break their strength by thy might, and bring down their power in thy anger; for they intend to defile thy sanctuary, and to pollute the tabernacle where thy glorious name rests, and to cast down the horn of thy altar with the sword.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.9">Behold their pride, and send thy wrath upon their heads; give to me, a widow, the strength to do what I plan.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.10">By the deceit of my lips strike down the slave with the prince and the prince with his servant; crush their arrogance by the hand of a woman.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.11">"For thy power depends not upon numbers, nor thy might upon men of strength; for thou art God of the lowly, helper of the oppressed, upholder of the weak, protector of the forlorn, savior of those without hope.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.9.12">Hear, O hear me, God of my father, God of the inheritance of Israel, Lord of heaven and earth, Creator of the waters, King of all thy creation, hear my prayer!</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Jdt.10" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.1">When Judith had ceased crying out to the God of Israel, and had ended all these words,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.2">she rose from where she lay prostrate and called her maid and went down into the house where she lived on sabbaths and on her feast days;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.3">and she removed the sackcloth which she had been wearing, and took off her widow's garments, and bathed her body with water, and anointed herself with precious ointment, and combed her hair and put on a tiara, and arrayed herself in her gayest apparel, which she used to wear while her husband Manasseh was living.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.4">And she put sandals on her feet, and put on her anklets and bracelets and rings, and her earrings and all her ornaments, and made herself very beautiful, to entice the eyes of all men who might see her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.5">And she gave her maid a bottle of wine and a flask of oil, and filled a bag with parched grain and a cake of dried fruit and fine bread; and she wrapped up all her vessels and gave them to her to carry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.6">Then they went out to the city gate of Bethulia, and found Uzziah standing there with the elders of the city, Chabris and Charmis.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.7">When they saw her, and noted how her face was altered and her clothing changed, they greatly admired her beauty, and said to her,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.8">"May the God of our fathers grant you favor and fulfil your plans, that the people of Israel may glory and Jerusalem may be exalted." And she worshiped God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.9">Then she said to them, "Order the gate of the city to be opened for me, and I will go out and accomplish the things about which you spoke with me." So they ordered the young men to open the gate for her, as she had said.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.10">When they had done this, Judith went out, she and her maid with her; and the men of the city watched her until she had gone down the mountain and passed through the valley and they could no longer see her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.11">The women went straight on through the valley; and an Assyrian patrol met her</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.12">and took her into custody, and asked her, "To what people do you belong, and where are you coming from, and where are you going?" She replied, "I am a daughter of the Hebrews, but I am fleeing from them, for they are about to be handed over to you to be devoured.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.13">I am on my way to the presence of Holofernes the commander of your army, to give him a true report; and I will show him a way by which he can go and capture all the hill country without losing one of his men, captured or slain."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.14">When the men heard her words, and observed her face -- she was in their eyes marvelously beautiful -- they said to her,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.15">"You have saved your life by hurrying down to the presence of our lord. Go at once to his tent; some of us will escort you and hand you over to him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.16">And when you stand before him, do not be afraid in your heart, but tell him just what you have said, and he will treat you well."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.17">They chose from their number a hundred men to accompany her and her maid, and they brought them to the tent of Holofernes.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.18">There was great excitement in the whole camp, for her arrival was reported from tent to tent, and they came and stood around her as she waited outside the tent of Holofernes while they told him about her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.19">And they marveled at her beauty, and admired the Israelites, judging them by her, and every one said to his neighbor, "Who can despise these people, who have women like this among them? Surely not a man of them had better be left alive, for if we let them go they will be able to ensnare the whole world!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.20">Then Holofernes' companions and all his servants came out and led her into the tent.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.21">Holofernes was resting on his bed, under a canopy which was woven with purple and gold and emeralds and precious stones.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.22">When they told him of her he came forward to the front of the tent, with silver lamps carried before him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.10.23">And when Judith came into the presence of Holofernes and his servants, they all marveled at the beauty of her face; and she prostrated herself and made obeisance to him, and his slaves raised her up.</verse>

        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.6">and sent to Holofernes and said, "Let my lord now command that your servant be permitted to go out and pray."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.7">So Holofernes commanded his guards not to hinder her. And she remained in the camp for three days, and went out each night to the valley of Bethulia, and bathed at the spring in the camp.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.8">When she came up from the spring she prayed the Lord God of Israel to direct her way for the raising up of her people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.9">So she returned clean and stayed in the tent until she ate her food toward evening.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.10">On the fourth day Holofernes held a banquet for his slave only, and did not invite any of his officers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.11">And he said to Bagoas, the eunuch who had charge of his personal affairs, "Go now and persuade the Hebrew woman who is in your care to join us and eat and drink with us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.12">For it will be a disgrace if we let such a woman go without enjoying her company, for if we do not embrace her she will laugh at us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.13">So Bagoas went out from the presence of Holofernes, and approached her and said, "This beautiful maidservant will please come to my lord and be honored in his presence, and drink wine and be merry with us, and become today like one of the daughters of the Assyrians who serve in the house of Nebuchadnezzar."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.14">And Judith said, "Who am I, to refuse my lord? Surely whatever pleases him I will do at once, and it will be a joy to me until the day of my death!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.15">So she got up and arrayed herself in all her woman's finery, and her maid went and spread on the ground for her before Holofernes the soft fleeces which she had received from Bagoas for her daily use, so that she might recline on them when she ate.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.16">Then Judith came in and lay down, and Holofernes' heart was ravished with her and he was moved with great desire to possess her; for he had been waiting for an opportunity to deceive her, ever since the day he first saw her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.17">So Holofernes said to her. "Drink now, and be merry with us!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.18">Judith said, "I will drink now, my lord, because my life means more to me today than in all the days since I was born."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.19">Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.12.20">And Holofernes was greatly pleased with her, and drank a great quantity of wine, much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since he was born.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Jdt.13" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.1">When evening came, his slaves quickly withdrew, and Bagoas closed the tent from outside and shut out the attendants from his master's presence; and they went to bed, for they all were weary because the banquet had lasted long.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.2">So Judith was left alone in the tent , with Holofernes stretched out on his bed, for he was overcome with wine.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.3">Now Judith had told her maid to stand outside the bedchamber and to wait for her to come out, as she did every day; for she said she would be going out for her prayers. And she had said the same thing to Bagoas.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.4">So every one went out, and no one, either small or great, was left in the bedchamber. Then Judith, standing beside his bed, said in her heart, "O Lord God of all might, look in this hour upon the work of my hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.5">For now is the time to help thy inheritance, and to carry out my undertaking for the destruction of the enemies who have risen up against us."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.6">She went up to the post at the end of the bed, above Holofernes' head, and took down his sword that hung there.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.7">She came close to his bed and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, "Give me strength this day, O Lord God of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.8">And she struck his neck twice with all her might, and severed it from his body.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.9">Then she tumbled his body off the bed and pulled down the canopy from the posts; after a moment she went out, and gave Holofernes' head to her maid,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.10">who placed it in her food bag. Then the two of them went out together, as they were accustomed to go for prayer; and they passed through the camp and circled around the valley and went up the mountain to Bethulia and came to its gates.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.11">Judith called out from afar to the watchmen at the gates, "Open, open the gate! God, our God, is still with us, to show his power in Israel, and his strength against our enemies, even as he has done this day!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.12">When the men of her city heard her voice, they hurried down to the city gate and called together the elders of the city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.13">They all ran together, both small and great, for it was unbelievable that she had returned; they opened the gate and admitted them, and they kindled a fire for light, and gathered around them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.14">Then she said to them with a loud voice, "Praise God, O praise him! Praise God, who has not withdrawn his mercy from the house of Israel, but has destroyed our enemies by my hand this very night!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.15">Then she took the head out of the bag and showed it to them, and said, "See, here is the head of Holofernes, the commander of the Assyrian army, and here is the canopy beneath which he lay in his drunken stupor. The Lord has struck him down by the hand of a woman.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.16">As the Lord lives, who has protected me in the way I went, it was my face that tricked him to his destruction, and yet he committed no act of sin with me, to defile and shame me."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.17">All the people were greatly astonished, and bowed down and worshiped God, and said with one accord, "Blessed art thou, our God, who hast brought into contempt this day the enemies of thy people."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.18">And Uzziah said to her, "O daughter, you are blessed by the Most High God above all women on earth; and blessed be the Lord God, who created the heavens and the earth, who has guided you to strike the head of the leader of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.19">Your hope will never depart from the hearts of men, as they remember the power of God.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.13.20">May God grant this to be a perpetual honor to you, and may he visit you with blessings, because you did not spare your own life when our nation was brought low, but have avenged our ruin, walking in the straight path before our God." And all the people said, "So be it, so be it!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Jdt.14" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.1">Then Judith said to them, "Listen to me, my brethren, and take this head and hang it upon the parapet of your wall.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.2">And as soon as morning comes and the sun rises, let every valiant man take his weapons and go out of the city, and set a captain over them, as if you were going down to the plain against the Assyrian outpost; only do not go down.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.3">Then they will seize their arms and go into the camp and rouse the officers of the Assyrian army; and they will rush into the tent of Holofernes, and will not find him. Then fear will come over them, and they will flee before you,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.4">and you and all who live within the borders of Israel shall pursue them and cut them down as they flee.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.5">But before you do all this, bring Achior the Ammonite to me, and let him see and recognize the man who despised the house of Israel and sent him to us as if to his death."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.6">So they summoned Achior from the house of Uzziah. And when he came and saw the head of Holofernes in the hand of one of the men at the gathering of the people, he fell down on his face and his spirit failed him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.7">And when they raised him up he fell at Judith's feet, and knelt before her, and said, "Blessed are you in every tent of Judah! In every nation those who hear your name will be alarmed.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.8">Now tell me what you have done during these days." Then Judith described to him in the presence of the people all that she had done, from the day she left until the moment of her speaking to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.9">And when she had finished, the people raised a great shout and made a joyful noise in their city.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.10">And when Achior saw all that the God of Israel had done, he believed firmly in God, and was circumcised, and joined the house of Israel, remaining so to this day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.11">As soon as it was dawn they hung the head of Holofernes on the wall, and every man took his weapons, and they went out in companies to the passes in the mountains.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.12">And when the Assyrians saw them they sent word to their commanders, and they went to the generals and the captains and to all their officers.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.13">So they came to Holofernes' tent and said to the steward in charge of all his personal affairs, "Wake up our lord, for the slaves have been so bold as to come down against us to give battle, in order to be destroyed completely."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.14">So Bagoas went in and knocked at the door of the tent, for he supposed that he was sleeping with Judith.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.15">But when no one answered, he opened it and went into the bedchamber and found him thrown down on the platform dead, with his head cut off and missing.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.16">And he cried out with a loud voice and wept and groaned and shouted, and rent his garments.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.17">Then he went to the tent where Judith had stayed, and when he did not find her he rushed out to the people and shouted,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.18">"The slaves have tricked us! One Hebrew woman has brought disgrace upon the house of King Nebuchadnezzar! For look, here is Holofernes lying on the ground, and his head is not on him!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.14.19">When the leaders of the Assyrian army heard this, they rent their tunics and were greatly dismayed, and their loud cries and shouts arose in the midst of the camp.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Jdt.15" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.1">When the men in the tents heard it, they were amazed at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.2">Fear and trembling came over them, so that they did not wait for one another, but with one impulse all rushed out and fled by every path across the plain and through the hill country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.3">Those who had camped in the hills around Bethulia also took to flight. Then the men of Israel, every one that was a soldier, rushed out upon them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.4">And Uzziah sent men to Betomasthaim and Bebai and Choba and Kola, and to all the frontiers of Israel, to tell what had taken place and to urge all to rush out upon their enemies to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.5">And when the Israelites heard it, with one accord they fell upon the enemy, and cut them down as far as Choba. Those in Jerusalem and all the hill country also came, for they were told what had happened in the camp of the enemy; and those in Gilead and in Galilee outflanked them with great slaughter, even beyond Damascus and its borders.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.6">The rest of the people of Bethulia fell upon the Assyrian camp and plundered it, and were greatly enriched.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.7">And the Israelites, when they returned from the slaughter, took possession of what remained, and the villages and towns in the hill country and in the plain got a great amount of booty, for there was a vast quantity of it.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.8">Then Joakim the high priest, and the senate of the people of Israel who lived at Jerusalem, came to witness the good things which the Lord had done for Israel, and to see Judith and to greet her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.9">And when they met her they all blessed her with one accord and said to her, "You are the exaltation of Jerusalem, you are the great glory of Israel, you are the great pride of our nation!</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.10">You have done all this singlehanded; you have done great good to Israel, and God is well pleased with it. May the Almighty Lord bless you for ever!" And all the people said, "So be it!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.11">So all the people plundered the camp for thirty days. They gave Judith the tent of Holofernes and all his silver dishes and his beds and his bowls and all his furniture; and she took them and loaded her mule and hitched up her carts and piled the things on them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.12">Then all the women of Israel gathered to see her, and blessed her, and some of them performed a dance for her; and she took branches in her hands and gave them to the women who were with her;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.15.13">and they crowned themselves with olive wreaths, she and those who were with her; and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women, while all the men of Israel followed, bearing their arms and wearing garlands and with songs on their lips.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Jdt.16" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.1">Then Judith began this thanksgiving before all Israel, and all the people loudly sang this song of praise.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.2">And Judith said, Begin a song to my God with tambourines, sing to my Lord with cymbals. Raise to him a new psalm; exalt him, and call upon his name.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.3">For God is the Lord who crushes wars; for he has delivered me out of the hands of my pursuers, and brought me to his camp, in the midst of the people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.4">The Assyrian came down from the mountains of the north; he came with myriads of his warriors; their multitude blocked up the valleys, their cavalry covered the hills.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.5">He boasted that he would burn up my territory, and kill my young men with the sword, and dash my infants to the ground and seize my children as prey, and take my virgins as booty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.6">But the Lord Almighty has foiled them by the hand of a woman.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.7">For their mighty one did not fall by the hands of the young men, nor did the sons of the Titans smite him, nor did tall giants set upon him; but Judith the daughter of Merari undid him with the beauty of her countenance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.8">For she took off her widow's mourning to exalt the oppressed in Israel. She anointed her face with ointment and fastened her hair with a tiara and put on a linen gown to deceive him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.9">Her sandal ravished his eyes, her beauty captivated his mind, and the sword severed his neck.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.10">The Persians trembled at her boldness, the Medes were daunted at her daring.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.11">Then my oppressed people shouted for joy; my weak people shouted and the enemy trembled; they lifted up their voices, and the enemy were turned back.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.12">The sons of maidservants have pierced them through; they were wounded like the children of fugitives, they perished before the army of my Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.13">I will sing to my God a new song: O Lord, thou are great and glorious, wonderful in strength, invincible.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.14">Let all thy creatures serve thee, for thou didst speak, and they were made. Thou didst send forth thy Spirit, and it formed them; there is none that can resist thy voice.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.15">For the mountains shall be shaken to their foundations with the waters; at thy presence the rocks shall melt like wax, but to those who fear thee thou wilt continue to show mercy.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.16">For every sacrifice as a fragrant offering is a small thing, and all fat for burnt offerings to thee is a very little thing, but he who fears the Lord shall be great for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.17">Woe to the nations that rise up against my people! The Lord Almighty will take vengeance on them in the day of judgment; fire and worms he will give to their flesh; they shall weep in pain for ever.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.18">When they arrived at Jerusalem they worshiped God. As soon as the people were purified, they offered their burnt offerings, their freewill offerings, and their gifts.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.19">Judith also dedicated to God all the vessels of Holofernes, which the people had given her; and the canopy which she took for herself from his bedchamber she gave as a votive offering to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.20">So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before the sanctuary for three months, and Judith remained with them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.21">After this every one returned home to his own inheritance, and Judith went to Bethulia, and remained on her estate, and was honored in her time throughout the whole country.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.22">Many desired to marry her, but she remained a widow all the days of her life after Manasseh her husband died and was gathered to his people.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.23">She became more and more famous, and grew old in her husband's house, until she was one hundred and five years old. She set her maid free. She died in Bethulia, and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasseh,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.24">and the house of Israel mourned for her seven days. Before she died she distributed her property to all those who were next of kin to her husband Manasseh, and to her own nearest kindred.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Jdt.16.25">And no one ever again spread terror among the people of Israel in the days of Judith, or for a long time after her death.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Sus.1" TEIform="div">
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.2">And he took a wife named Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, a very beautiful woman and one who feared the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.3">Her parents were righteous, and had taught their daughter according to the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.4">Joakim was very rich, and had a spacious garden adjoining his house; and the Jews used to come to him because he was the most honored of them all.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.5">In that year two elders from the people were appointed as judges. Concerning them the Lord had said: "Iniquity came forth from Babylon, from elders who were judges, who were supposed to govern the people."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.6">These men were frequently at Joakim's house, and all who had suits at law came to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.7">When the people departed at noon, Susanna would go into her husband's garden to walk.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.8">The two elders used to see her every day, going in and walking about, and they began to desire her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.9">And they perverted their minds and turned away their eyes from looking to Heaven or remembering righteous judgments.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.10">Both were overwhelmed with passion for her, but they did not tell each other of their distress,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.11">for they were ashamed to disclose their lustful desire to possess her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.12">And they watched eagerly, day after day, to see her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.13">They said to each other, "Let us go home, for it is mealtime."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.14">And when they went out, they parted from each other. But turning back, they met again; and when each pressed the other for the reason, they confessed their lust. And then together they arranged for a time when they could find her alone.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.15">Once, while they were watching for an opportune day, she went in as before with only two maids, and wished to bathe in the garden, for it was very hot.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.16">And no one was there except the two elders, who had hid themselves and were watching her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.17">She said to her maids, "Bring me oil and ointments, and shut the garden doors so that I may bathe."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.18">They did as she said, shut the garden doors, and went out by the side doors to bring what they had been commanded; and they did not see the elders, because they were hidden.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.19">When the maids had gone out, the two elders rose and ran to her, and said:</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.20">"Look, the garden doors are shut, no one sees us, and we are in love with you; so give your consent, and lie with us.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.21">If you refuse, we will testify against you that a young man was with you, and this was why you sent your maids away."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.22">Susanna sighed deeply, and said, "I am hemmed in on every side. For if I do this thing, it is death for me; and if I do not, I shall not escape your hands.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.23">I choose not to do it and to fall into your hands, rather than to sin in the sight of the Lord."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.24">Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and the two elders shouted against her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.25">And one of them ran and opened the garden doors.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.26">When the household servants heard the shouting in the garden, they rushed in at the side door to see what had happened to her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.27">And when the elders told their tale, the servants were greatly ashamed, for nothing like this had ever been said about Susanna.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.28">The next day, when the people gathered at the house of her husband Joakim, the two elders came, full of their wicked plot to have Susanna put to death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.29">They said before the people, "Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, who is the wife of Joakim."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.30">So they sent for her. And she came, with her parents, her children, and all her kindred.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.31">Now Susanna was a woman of great refinement, and beautiful in appearance.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.32">As she was veiled, the wicked men ordered her to be unveiled, that they might feed upon her beauty.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.33">But her family and friends and all who saw her wept.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.34">Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, and laid their hands upon her head.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.35">And she, weeping, looked up toward heaven, for her heart trusted in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.36">The elders said, "As we were walking in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, shut the garden doors, and dismissed the maids.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.37">Then a young man, who had been hidden, came to her and lay with her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.38">We were in a corner of the garden, and when we saw this wickedness we ran to them.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.39">We saw them embracing, but we could not hold the man, for he was too strong for us, and he opened the doors and dashed out.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.40">So we seized this woman and asked her who the young man was, but she would not tell us. These things we testify."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.41">The assembly believed them, because they were elders of the people and judges; and they condemned her to death.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.42">Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, "O eternal God, who dost discern what is secret, who art aware of all things before they come to be,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.43">thou knowest that these men have borne false witness against me. And now I am to die! Yet I have done none of the things that they have wickedly invented against me!"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.44">The Lord heard her cry.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.45">And as she was being led away to be put to death, God aroused the holy spirit of a young lad named Daniel;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.46">and he cried with a loud voice, "I am innocent of the blood of this woman."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.47">All the people turned to him, and said, "What is this that you have said?"</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.48">Taking his stand in the midst of them, he said, "Are you such fools, you sons of Israel? Have you condemned a daughter of Israel without examination and without learning the facts?</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.49">Return to the place of judgment. For these men have borne false witness against her."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.50">Then all the people returned in haste. And the elders said to him, "Come, sit among us and inform us, for God has given you that right."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.51">And Daniel said to them, "Separate them far from each other, and I will examine them."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.52">When they were separated from each other, he summoned one of them and said to him, "You old relic of wicked days, your sins have now come home, which you have committed in the past,</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.53">pronouncing unjust judgments, condemning the innocent and letting the guilty go free, though the Lord said, `Do not put to death an innocent and righteous person.'</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.54">Now then, if you really saw her, tell me this: Under what tree did you see them being intimate with each other?" He answered, "Under a mastic tree."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.55">And Daniel said, "Very well! You have lied against your own head, for the angel of God has received the sentence from God and will immediately cut you in two."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.56">Then he put him aside, and commanded them to bring the other. And he said to him, "You offspring of Canaan and not of Judah, beauty has deceived you and lust has perverted your heart.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.57">This is how you both have been dealing with the daughters of Israel, and they were intimate with you through fear; but a daughter of Judah would not endure your wickedness.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.58">Now then, tell me: Under what tree did you catch them being intimate with each other?" He answered, "Under an evergreen oak."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.59">And Daniel said to him, "Very well! You also have lied against your own head, for the angel of God is waiting with his sword to saw you in two, that he may destroy you both."</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.60">Then all the assembly shouted loudly and blessed God, who saves those who hope in him.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.61">And they rose against the two elders, for out of their own mouths Daniel had convicted them of bearing false witness;</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.62">and they did to them as they had wickedly planned to do to their neighbor; acting in accordance with the law of Moses, they put them to death. Thus innocent blood was saved that day.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.63">And Hilkiah and his wife praised God for their daughter Susanna, and so did Joakim her husband and all her kindred, because nothing shameful was found in her.</verse>
        <verse canonical="true" osisID="Sus.1.64">And from that day onward Daniel had a great reputation among the people.</verse>
